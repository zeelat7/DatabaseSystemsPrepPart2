Our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred.

This\nsystem-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the\nsystem significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System\nWarning shall remain in place until further notice.\n\nWeather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and\nshippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation\nof the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's\nstorage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is\nvirtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system\noperational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual\nimbalances left on the system.\n\nBecause of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas\nEastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being\nleft on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate\nwith their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to\nmatch actual customer takes in the market area.

The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is \"significant potential for undue discrimination\" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.\n\nFERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY\n\nActing on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is\nnot, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean\nheavily on the \"linchpin\" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a\ndeal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.\nDuring discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was \"important to keep in mind, as we\nrush into the brave new world on the gas side,\" that \"all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory\nbasis by pipelines.\" Last week's proclamation should be considered \"a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory\ntrend,\" he asserted.\nIn representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties \"are clear about contracting\npractices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those\nthat we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk\" of such unequal treatment.\nFERC declared that a \"key factor\" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an\n\"appropriate material deviation\" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates\nprovide \"adequate alternatives\" to other shippers.\nIn cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline\nCo. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the\nbuyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally\navailable tariffs.\nThe provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to\nthe end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a\nnegotiated-rate package, \"we have reconsidered that holding\" because similar buyout opportunities are\nnot available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.\nWhere a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an\n\"adequate alternative,\" the commission observed. \"However, if the customer desires a special contract\ndemand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability\nof service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not\ninclude any such provision.\" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain\ndegree of risk, giving it \"an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,\" the commission pointed out.\n\"A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a\nvaluable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,\"\nFERC said, adding that \"such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.\"\nRequiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under\nwhich they will offer contract demand reduction rights \"is the best means of assuring that those rights will\nbe negotiated\" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language \"will require the\npipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.\"\nCommissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in\nthe arm for a program that had become \"muddled.\" Through a \"tortured line of cases,\" FERC's definitions\nof allowable contracting practices were \"obscured,\" Breathitt said in welcoming the new \"common-sense\"\napproach. The \"tug of war\" that parties have engaged in over the past few years \"really hasn't served our\nobjective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service\" are available to all shippers, she said.","headers":{"Date":"Mon, 26 Nov 2001 10:44:56 -0800 (PST)","From":"victor.lamadrid@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c20904007.1075862464229.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FW: New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals","To":"robert.allwein@enron.com, airam.arteaga@enron.com, sunjay.arya@enron.com, \r\n\u0009shanna.boudreaux@enron.com, tamara.carter@enron.com, \r\n\u0009joann.collins@enron.com, stephanie.erwin@enron.com, \r\n\u0009clarissa.garcia@enron.com, steve.gillespie@enron.com, \r\n\u0009lia.halstead@enron.com, meredith.homco@enron.com, \r\n\u0009kelly.loocke@enron.com, chris.ordway@enron.com, \r\n\u0009michael.pritchard@enron.com, dan.prudenti@enron.com, \r\n\u0009robert.ramirez@enron.com, christina.sanchez@enron.com, \r\n\u0009tracy.wood@enron.com","X-From":"Lamadrid, Victor \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=VLAMADR\u003e","X-To":"Allwein, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rallwei\u003e, Arteaga, Airam \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aarteag\u003e, Arya, Sunjay \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sarya\u003e, Boudreaux, Shanna \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sboudrea\u003e, Carter, Tamara \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tcarter4\u003e, Collins, Joann \u003cJoann.Collins@ENRON.com\u003e, Erwin, Stephanie \u003cStephanie.erwin@enron.com\u003e, Garcia, Clarissa \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgarcia\u003e, Gillespie, Steve \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgillesp\u003e, Halstead, Lia \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lhalstea\u003e, Homco, Meredith \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mmitch2\u003e, Loocke, Kelly \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kloocke\u003e, Ordway, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cordway\u003e, Pritchard, Michael \u003cMichael.pritchard@enron.com\u003e, Prudenti, Dan \u003cDan.prudenti@enron.com\u003e, Ramirez, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rramire3\u003e, Sanchez, Christina \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Csanche\u003e, Wood, Tracy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Twood2\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":"Ames, Chuck \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cames\u003e, Brawner, Sandra F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbrawne\u003e, Germany, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgerman\u003e, Goodell, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgoodel\u003e, Hodge, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhodge2\u003e, Keavey, Peter F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pkeavey\u003e, Mckay, Brad \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bmckay\u003e, Mckay, Jonathan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmckay1\u003e, Neal, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sneal\u003e, Pereira, Susan W. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spereir\u003e, Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vpimenov\u003e, Ring, Andrea \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aring\u003e, Savvas, Leonidas \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lsavvas\u003e, Smith, Maureen \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mgreena\u003e, Taylor, Craig \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtaylo2\u003e, Townsend, Judy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtownse\u003e, Versen, Victoria \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vversen\u003e, Vickers, Frank \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Fvicker\u003e"},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

Based on\nanticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,\nTexas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt\nsteps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to\nactual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of\nactual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual\ndeliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until\nfurther notice.\n\nWeather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and\nshippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation\nof the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's\nstorage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is\nvirtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system\noperational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual\nimbalances left on the system.\n\nDue to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas\nEastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being\nleft on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate\nwith their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system\nmatch actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be\naccepted into the system until further notice.\n\nIf immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of\ngas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an\noperational flow order (\"OFO\") requiring actual receipts of gas to match\nactual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO\nnon-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as\nprovided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take\nany other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its\nsystem, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*******************************************************************\n\nNOTE:\n\nDuke Energy Gas Transmission respects your online time and privacy.\nYou have received this email because you elected to subscribe.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbdd1e2d32371058a55"},"body":"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.\n\nFirst, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.\n\nThe Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.\n\nSteve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  \n\nAs you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.\n\nIn addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.\n\nWe will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.\n\nThank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.\n\nLink to the press release: http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/012902Release.html\n","headers":{"Date":"Tue, 29 Jan 2002 07:25:46 -0800 (PST)","From":"coo.jeff@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c1587180.1075841404777.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Management Changes","To":"dl-ga-all_netco@enron.com","X-From":"Jeff McMahon - President \u0026 COO \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MBX_ANNCJMCMAHON\u003e","X-To":"DL-GA-all_NETCO \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DL-GA-all_NETCO\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

This fix will take care of this morning's problem.\n\nEOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:\n\u0009message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId=\"\" BridgeEntityName=\"EOLBridge\" Message=\"Missing StartDate or EndDate\" Status=\"F\" BridgeDate=\"20011025170945CDT\"}\n\nI throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the \"Bid Week\" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.\n\n-Dat Truong x63015\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \u0009Truong, Dat  \nSent:\u0009Thursday, October 25, 2001 11:11 AM\nTo:\u0009Moorer, Torrey; Lamadrid, Victor; Severson, Russ; Grant, George\nCc:\u0009Husain, Karima; Lim, Francis S.; Saluja, Gurdip; Sweitzer, Tara\nSubject:\u0009Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today\n\nThe problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.\n\nThe corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate. \n\n-Dat Truong ","headers":{"Date":"Mon, 29 Oct 2001 09:49:02 -0800 (PST)","From":"victor.lamadrid@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c13906218.1075863448598.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FW: Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production","To":"robert.allwein@enron.com, airam.arteaga@enron.com, \r\n\u0009shanna.boudreaux@enron.com, tamara.carter@enron.com, \r\n\u0009joann.collins@enron.com, stephanie.erwin@enron.com, \r\n\u0009clarissa.garcia@enron.com, steve.gillespie@enron.com, \r\n\u0009lia.halstead@enron.com, meredith.homco@enron.com, \r\n\u0009kelly.loocke@enron.com, scott.loving@enron.com, \r\n\u0009chris.ordway@enron.com, michael.pritchard@enron.com, \r\n\u0009dan.prudenti@enron.com, robert.ramirez@enron.com, \r\n\u0009christina.sanchez@enron.com, tracy.wood@enron.com","X-From":"Lamadrid, Victor \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=VLAMADR\u003e","X-To":"Allwein, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rallwei\u003e, Arteaga, Airam \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aarteag\u003e, Boudreaux, Shanna \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sboudrea\u003e, Carter, Tamara \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tcarter4\u003e, Collins, Joann \u003cJoann.Collins@ENRON.com\u003e, Erwin, Stephanie \u003cStephanie.erwin@enron.com\u003e, Garcia, Clarissa \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgarcia\u003e, Gillespie, Steve \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgillesp\u003e, Halstead, Lia \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lhalstea\u003e, Homco, Meredith \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mmitch2\u003e, Loocke, Kelly \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kloocke\u003e, Loving, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sloving\u003e, Ordway, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cordway\u003e, Pritchard, Michael \u003cMichael.pritchard@enron.com\u003e, Prudenti, Dan \u003cDan.prudenti@enron.com\u003e, Ramirez, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rramire3\u003e, Sanchez, Christina \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Csanche\u003e, Wood, Tracy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Twood2\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":"Superty, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rsupert\u003e, Hall, Bob M \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rhall3\u003e, Kinsey, Lisa \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lkinsey\u003e, Sullivan, Patti \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Psulliv\u003e, Smith, George F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gsmith\u003e, Pinion, Richard \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rpinion\u003e, Jaquet, Tammy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tjaquet\u003e, Farmer, Daren J. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dfarmer\u003e, Greif, Donna \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dcorrig\u003e, Ames, Chuck \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cames\u003e, Brawner, Sandra F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbrawne\u003e, Germany, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgerman\u003e, Goodell, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgoodel\u003e, Hodge, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhodge2\u003e, Keavey, Peter F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pkeavey\u003e, Mckay, Brad \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bmckay\u003e, Mckay, Jonathan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmckay1\u003e, Neal, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sneal\u003e, Pereira, Susan W. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spereir\u003e, Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vpimenov\u003e, Ring, Andrea \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aring\u003e, Savvas, Leonidas \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lsavvas\u003e, Smith, Maureen \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mgreena\u003e, Taylor, Craig \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtaylo2\u003e, Townsend, Judy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtownse\u003e, Versen, Victoria \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vversen\u003e, Vickers, Frank \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Fvicker\u003e"},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

Our anger quotient alone, even when doing standard stuff like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable enough to make even armed men in turbans tremble.\nWe've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them and their future. We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't left already. And for those of us who are single, the prospect of finding a good man with whom to share life is about as likely as being struck by lightning.  We have nothing to lose. We've survived the water diet, the protein diet, the carbohydrate diet, and the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across America and never lost a pound. We can easily survive months in the hostile terrain of Afghanistan with no food at all!\nWe've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware stores, or sporting events...finding bin Laden in some cave will be no problem.\nUniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government? Oh, please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and extended families at Thanksgiving dinners for years ... we understand tribal warfare.\nBetween us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick there is for how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money sources. We know how to find that money and we know how to seize it ... with or without the government's help!\nLet us go and fight. The Taliban hates women. Imagine their terror as we crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain. I'm going to write my Congresswoman.

Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.\n\nThe corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate. \n\n-Dat Truong ","headers":{"Date":"Thu, 25 Oct 2001 09:27:22 -0700 (PDT)","From":"victor.lamadrid@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c14927886.1075863450857.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FW: Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today","To":"chuck.ames@enron.com, f..brawner@enron.com, chris.germany@enron.com, \r\n\u0009scott.goodell@enron.com, john.hodge@enron.com, f..keavey@enron.com, \r\n\u0009brad.mckay@enron.com, jonathan.mckay@enron.com, scott.neal@enron.com, \r\n\u0009w..pereira@enron.com, vladi.pimenov@enron.com, andrea.ring@enron.com, \r\n\u0009leonidas.savvas@enron.com, maureen.smith@enron.com, \r\n\u0009craig.taylor@enron.com, judy.townsend@enron.com, \r\n\u0009victoria.versen@enron.com, frank.vickers@enron.com","X-From":"Lamadrid, Victor \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=VLAMADR\u003e","X-To":"Ames, Chuck \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cames\u003e, Brawner, Sandra F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbrawne\u003e, Germany, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgerman\u003e, Goodell, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgoodel\u003e, Hodge, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhodge2\u003e, Keavey, Peter F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pkeavey\u003e, Mckay, Brad \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bmckay\u003e, Mckay, Jonathan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmckay1\u003e, Neal, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sneal\u003e, Pereira, Susan W. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spereir\u003e, Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vpimenov\u003e, Ring, Andrea \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aring\u003e, Savvas, Leonidas \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lsavvas\u003e, Smith, Maureen \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mgreena\u003e, Taylor, Craig \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtaylo2\u003e, Townsend, Judy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtownse\u003e, Versen, Victoria \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vversen\u003e, Vickers, Frank \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Fvicker\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":"Superty, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rsupert\u003e, Smith, George F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gsmith\u003e, Pinion, Richard \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rpinion\u003e, Jaquet, Tammy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tjaquet\u003e, Kinsey, Lisa \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lkinsey\u003e, Schrab, Mark L. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mschrab\u003e, Sullivan, Patti \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Psulliv\u003e, Farmer, Daren J. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dfarmer\u003e, Hall, Bob M \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rhall3\u003e, Calcagno, Suzanne \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Scalcagn\u003e, Greif, Donna \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dcorrig\u003e, Allwein, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rallwei\u003e, Arteaga, Airam \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aarteag\u003e, Boudreaux, Shanna \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sboudrea\u003e, Carter, Tamara \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tcarter4\u003e, Collins, Joann \u003cJoann.Collins@ENRON.com\u003e, Erwin, Stephanie  \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Serwin2\u003e, Garcia, Clarissa \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgarcia\u003e, Gillespie, Steve \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgillesp\u003e, Halstead, Lia \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lhalstea\u003e, Homco, Meredith \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mmitch2\u003e, Loocke, Kelly \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kloocke\u003e, Loving, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sloving\u003e, Ordway, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cordway\u003e, Prudenti, Dan \u003cdan.prudenti@enron.com\u003e, Ramirez, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rramire3\u003e, Sanchez, Christina \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Csanche\u003e, Wood, Tracy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Twood2\u003e"},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:\n\nProducer/Wellhead Group \nThe current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.\n\nStrategic Asset  Development\nLaura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbdd1e2d32371058a93"},"body":"\nToday we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  \n\nJeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.\n\nI know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.\n\nPlease join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.","headers":{"Date":"Wed, 24 Oct 2001 13:50:20 -0700 (PDT)","From":"no.address@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c3044596.1075863451082.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","X-From":"Ken Lay- Chairman of the Board@ENRON","X-To":"All Enron Worldwide@ENRON","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. \nWilliams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 \u003chttp://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html\u003e). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. \nPetal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. \nANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.

To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:\n\n1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.\n\n2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.

Come join the fun.\n\nThank you for your support and generosity.\n\nMike McConnell","headers":{"Date":"Mon, 22 Oct 2001 20:16:30 -0700 (PDT)","From":"no.address@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c33059778.1075863452831.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"JDRF Cyber Auction \u0026 Update Information","X-From":"EGM Office of the Chairman@ENRON","X-To":"All Enron Houston@ENRON","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

He is walking on behalf of our daughter, Sydney, who was born in May of this year with Congenital Heart Disease.  If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbdd1e2d32371058ac1"},"body":"\nEarlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.\n \nWe are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.\n \nIf you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.\n \nThank you for your support.\n \nEnron Global Technology\n \n \n \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration \nSent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM \nTo: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON \nCc: \nSubject: Supported Internet Email Addresses\n\n\n\nEnron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.\n\nAny new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.\n\nTo determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.\n\nIMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test \u0026 confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.\n\nWe will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.\n\nThank you for participation, cooperation and support. \n\nEnron Messaging Administration","headers":{"Date":"Thu, 18 Oct 2001 15:10:12 -0700 (PDT)","From":"no.address@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c30542090.1075863455117.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","X-From":"Enron Global Technology@ENRON","X-To":"All Enron Worldwide@ENRON","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

The information provided below is subject to change for numerous \nreasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and \ndecisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure \nevents, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update \nit periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that \nthe specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the \nspecified dates. \n\nSUBJECT:   LINE SM-123\n\nColumbia anticipates that between October 25th and October 27th, Line SM-123 \nwill be taken out of service due to long-wall mining activity.  Columbia \nestimates the line to be out of service for twenty-one (21) days.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbdd1e2d32371058ade"},"body":"\nToday, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.\n\nWe made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.\n\nOver the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.\n\nFollowing are the highlights of our businesses:\n\nWholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).\nAmericas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).\nEurope and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.\n\nRetail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.\n\n\nTransportation and Distribution:\n\u0009Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.\nPortland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.\nGlobal Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.\n\nBroadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.\n\nCorporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.\n\nIn addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:\n?\u0009A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.\n?\u0009$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.\n?\u0009$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  \n\nWith our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.\nAny new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.\nTo determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.\nIMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test \u0026 confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.\nWe will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks.

So, Gas Structuring will close for business effective 3:00 PM t=\r\noday and reopen tomorrow morning.  If you or anyone on your team have an ur=\r\ngent matter that has to be addressed today, please make every effort to get=\r\n to us in time for us to respond before 3:00 PM.  Also, please forward this=\r\n notice to the persons on your respective teams.

As such, we are seeking proposals to \"pass through\" th=\r\nese \"incentives\" to any person or persons who would like to \"outsource\" our=\r\n sweep process.  Proposals will be accepted up until 12:00 PM today.  We re=\r\nserve to right to accept all or any part of  any proposal and may or may no=\r\nt negotiate with one or more parties to provide the sweep service.  All swe=\r\nep outsourcing proposals are subject to move regulator approval.  Any chang=\r\ne in move regulation that results in a reduction in incentives being enjoye=\r\nd by Gas Structuring will require that the outsourcing party keep Gas Struc=\r\nturing whole.  Baseball arbitration for all disputes.  This agreement will =\r\nbe governed by Texas Law and we will give the successful outsourcing party(=\r\nies) our contract to sign immediately prior to work commencing.  No changes=\r\n to the contract will be allowed since the move regulators have already app=\r\nroved the agreement.  We will answer no questions regarding the size or num=\r\nber of files to be swept.  You must obtain any information regarding the si=\r\nze or number of files, type or quantity or refreshments, type and quantity =\r\nof snacks and other such data from public sources.

Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order, so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized.  Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order (almost $80m), it's likely that the dollars will be subject to the on-going negotiations taking place in Transco's RP01-245 rate case proceeding.   I'll coordinate with Tammy to insure that we've got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes.\n\nOn Texas Gas, this represents a minor win for us--we had argued that Texas Gas' proposal was not consistent with Order 637 and that they should adopt a more \"Transco-like\" scheme that creates uncertainty w/o creating undue penalties.  Texas Gas will have to refile \u0026 we'll have another go-round between the marketing companies/producers and the LDC's on the Texas Gas system.  Will keep you posted.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nSuzanne\nx54880\n=============================================================================================================\nTRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT 1LINE SYSTEM, OTHER RATE CHANGES\n\nCapping a long-running debate over the 1Line proposal, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., with only a minor exception or two, received approval from FERC to implement a new online, interactive computer system. Last month's ruling also went a long way toward completing Transco's effort to comply with orders 637 and 587.  The 1Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos. Inc. to put in place new practices and services, including ones related to compliance with orders 637 and 587.\n\nAccording to Transco, its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems. But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transco's proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how 1Line complies with orders 637 and 587 (IF, 2 April, 16). Looking at the 1Line plan from an order 637 and 587 perspective, FERC in the Sept. 27 order (RP01-236, et al.) found most of the scheme to its liking. It accepted Transco's proposal to change the capacity-release bidding and awarding processes, to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule, and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill, rather than the subsequent commodity bill.\n\nThe commission approved Transco's proposal on scheduling equality, which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. To raise its comfort level about the provision, FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shipper's nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shipper's ability to specify when the release will become effective. FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims. In response to one protester, the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transco's affiliates as well.\n\nOn order 637 matters, FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transco's positions on issues such as imbalance services, operational controls and penalty revenue sharing.\nFERC was less enthused with Transco's preferred approach to interaction between the pipeline's segmentation and discounting policies. Refuting the claim that it already complies with order 637 on this issue, FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shipper's right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction. Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours.\n\nFERC also accepted Transco's existing imbalance cash-out tolerances and tiered cash-out mechanisms, but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties. The pipeline has not ad-equately justified \"why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on non-critical days,\" said the\ncommission. FERC rejected Transco's proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading, which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges. The commission ruled that \"Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue.\" But the commission went on to say that it \"may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading\" to avoid certain charges.\n\nTransco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances. FERC said that \"it is not clear from Transco's explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded.\"\n\n=============================================================================================================\nFERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS' PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism, while rejecting the proposed use of high/low daily pricing for cashouts. The revamped mechanism, which was developed during and after a technical conference, would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co. to \"remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system,\" FERC said.\n\nTo stop customers from gaming its system, Texas Gas in March proposed (RP01-278) a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts, to eliminate pool-to-pool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances, and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing\nplant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at 100% of the applicable index price. Seeing the need for the proposed changes, the commission noted that Texas Gas \"has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided.\"\n\nHowever, FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month. Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language, the order explained that daily high/low index prices \"may unduly increase penalties for imbalances, which is contrary to order 637.\"\n\nThe order went on to say that \"a less draconian measure\" may be appropriate. For instance, Texas Gas could propose a mechanism \"that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price\" if it wanted to provide \"an incentive for shippers to remain in balance,\" FERC said.","headers":{"Date":"Fri, 12 Oct 2001 09:32:17 -0700 (PDT)","From":"victor.lamadrid@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c17760087.1075863458103.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FW:","To":"chuck.ames@enron.com, f..brawner@enron.com, chris.germany@enron.com, \r\n\u0009scott.goodell@enron.com, john.hodge@enron.com, f..keavey@enron.com, \r\n\u0009brad.mckay@enron.com, jonathan.mckay@enron.com, scott.neal@enron.com, \r\n\u0009w..pereira@enron.com, vladi.pimenov@enron.com, andrea.ring@enron.com, \r\n\u0009leonidas.savvas@enron.com, maureen.smith@enron.com, \r\n\u0009craig.taylor@enron.com, judy.townsend@enron.com, \r\n\u0009victoria.versen@enron.com, w..vickers@enron.com","X-From":"Lamadrid, Victor \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=VLAMADR\u003e","X-To":"Ames, Chuck \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cames\u003e, Brawner, Sandra F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbrawne\u003e, Germany, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgerman\u003e, Goodell, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgoodel\u003e, Hodge, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhodge2\u003e, Keavey, Peter F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pkeavey\u003e, Mckay, Brad \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bmckay\u003e, Mckay, Jonathan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmckay1\u003e, Neal, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sneal\u003e, Pereira, Susan W. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spereir\u003e, Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vpimenov\u003e, Ring, Andrea \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aring\u003e, Savvas, Leonidas \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lsavvas\u003e, Smith, Maureen \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mgreena\u003e, Taylor, Craig \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtaylo2\u003e, Townsend, Judy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtownse\u003e, Versen, Victoria \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vversen\u003e, Vickers, Frank W. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Fvicker\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":"Homco, Meredith \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mmitch2\u003e, Villarreal, Jesse \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jvillar\u003e, Smith, George F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gsmith\u003e"},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

Structuring needs you Gas Daily Daily offer for 30 peak day at TETCO M3.  You previously indicated US$0.13 for 40,000 a day and it looks like they are going to do the whole volume.  They will notify you by 9:00 am the day before delivery.\n\nI don't know what the right price is but it would seem that we could anticipate their need to call and get in front of  the market moves.

Will keep you posted as the project progresses through FERC.\n\nSuzanne\n============================================================================================================\nSOUTHERN NATURAL FILES $245 MILLION PROPOSAL TO BOOST CAPACITY\nTo serve local distributors, industrial users and power generators, Southern Natural Gas Co. filed with FERC last week to build $245 million worth of compression, pipeline looping and other facilities to transport a total of 359,891 Mcf/day. The project would be constructed in two phases.\n\nThe expansion would start moving 320,714 Mcf/day by June 1, 2003, said the Oct. 1 application (CP02-1 et. al.). In the project's second phase, Southern Natural would install additional facilities to move 39,177 Mcf/day by May 1, 2004. Phase one includes 114.5 miles of looping in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, which would be built in 11 segments that range in length from 3.41 miles to 16.74 miles. Pipe diameters would range from 24 inches to 36 inches. Phase two includes 8.8 miles of 30-inch-diameter looping in Georgia that would be\nconstructed in two segments of 4.8 miles and 4.0 miles.\n\nSouthern Natural proposed installing a total of 76,930 horsepower of compression, of which 11,280 hp would replace existing compression facilities that have deteriorated or otherwise become obsolete. Phase one includes ten compression units ranging in size from 3,550 hp to 15,000 hp. Under phase two, one 4,730 hp unit would be installed. Furthermore, Southern Natural proposed abandoning six compressors that generate a total of 9,930 hp.\n\nAll 359,891 Mcf/day of the capacity has been subscribed, the application said. During an open season held between Dec. 15 and Jan. 26, firm service agreements were reached with Southern Co. Services Inc., 97,950 Mcf/day, Calpine Energy Services LP, 95,000 Mcf/day, SCANA Resources Inc., 93,046 Mcf/day, Effingham County Power LLC, 58,766 Mcf/day, the City of Austell, Ga., 6,366 Mcf/day, Morgan Stanley, 5,400 Mcf/day, Proctor \u0026 Gamble, 1,763, and Kimberly-Clark, 1,600 Mcf/day.\n\nSouthern Natural asked FERC to allow it to roll in the cost of the expansion in its next rate proceeding \"based on the considerable benefit to the overall rates of existing customers.\" Revenues generated from the new contracts are expected to exceed project costs by approximately $154 million, thus the expansion would result in \"a significant benefit\" to current shippers, Southern Natural said. In addition to the financial benefits, existing shippers will enjoy operational benefits as well, said the pipeline. \"The combination of additional compression and new loop pipeline represents a significant enhancement to system reliability for all shippers delivering gas\" in Southern Natural's market area, the\napplication said. Furthermore, Southern Natural promised that service to existing shippers would not be degraded as a result of the project.","headers":{"Date":"Wed, 10 Oct 2001 17:07:22 -0700 (PDT)","From":"victor.lamadrid@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c2501256.1075863459217.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FW: SOUTHERN NATURAL FILES $245 MILLION PROPOSAL TO BOOST CAPACITY","To":"robert.allwein@enron.com, airam.arteaga@enron.com, \r\n\u0009shanna.boudreaux@enron.com, tamara.carter@enron.com, \r\n\u0009joann.collins@enron.com, clarissa.garcia@enron.com, \r\n\u0009steve.gillespie@enron.com, lia.halstead@enron.com, \r\n\u0009meredith.homco@enron.com, kelly.loocke@enron.com, \r\n\u0009scott.loving@enron.com, chris.ordway@enron.com, \r\n\u0009dan.prudenti@enron.com, robert.ramirez@enron.com, \r\n\u0009christina.sanchez@enron.com, tracy.wood@enron.com","X-From":"Lamadrid, Victor \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=VLAMADR\u003e","X-To":"Allwein, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rallwei\u003e, Arteaga, Airam \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aarteag\u003e, Boudreaux, Shanna \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sboudrea\u003e, Carter, Tamara \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tcarter4\u003e, Collins, Joann \u003cJoann.Collins@ENRON.com\u003e, Garcia, Clarissa \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgarcia\u003e, Gillespie, Steve \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgillesp\u003e, Halstead, Lia \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lhalstea\u003e, Homco, Meredith \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mmitch2\u003e, Loocke, Kelly \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kloocke\u003e, Loving, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sloving\u003e, Ordway, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cordway\u003e, Prudenti, Dan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dprudent\u003e, Ramirez, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rramire3\u003e, Sanchez, Christina \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Csanche\u003e, Wood, Tracy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Twood2\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":"Ames, Chuck \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cames\u003e, Brawner, Sandra F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbrawne\u003e, Germany, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgerman\u003e, Goodell, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgoodel\u003e, Hodge, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhodge2\u003e, Keavey, Peter F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pkeavey\u003e, Mckay, Brad \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bmckay\u003e, Mckay, Jonathan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmckay1\u003e, Neal, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sneal\u003e, Pereira, Susan W. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spereir\u003e, Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vpimenov\u003e, Ring, Andrea \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aring\u003e, Savvas, Leonidas \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lsavvas\u003e, Smith, Maureen \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mgreena\u003e, Taylor, Craig \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtaylo2\u003e, Townsend, Judy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtownse\u003e, Versen, Victoria \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vversen\u003e, Vickers, Frank W. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Fvicker\u003e"},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbdd1e2d32371058b20"},"body":"\r\nEnron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=\r\ne of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=\r\nl) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =\r\nthere are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=\r\ne steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=\r\nes and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=\r\nty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.\r\n\r\nPrimary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=\r\ntrols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=\r\ne (\u003chttp://home.enron.com/security\u003e), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =\r\n(CorporateSecurity@enron.com \u003cmailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com\u003e).  John B=\r\nrindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=\r\ne feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =\r\nor to report security threats.\r\n\r\nWe have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=\r\nhe Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.\r\n\r\nAccess to the Enron Center\r\n\r\nOver the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=\r\ntituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):\r\n\r\n?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =\r\nCenter, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.\r\n\r\n?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =\r\npicture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=\r\n. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=\r\nication).=20\r\n\r\n?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=\r\n in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=\r\nrd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=\r\nr foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=\r\ntion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.\r\n\r\n?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=\r\nadged contractor at all times.\r\n\r\n?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=\r\nyee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=\r\nn area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=\r\nent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=\r\n the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=\r\n, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =\r\nescorting employee or badged contractor.\r\n\r\n?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =\r\nworkplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=\r\nrity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=\r\nou or hold doors open, allowing \"tail gating\" by others.\r\n\r\nThese will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=\r\nuted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=\r\n in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=\r\npment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=\r\nse measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09\r\n\r\n\r\nTravel Advisory Update\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=\r\ntions:\r\n\r\n?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=\r\ns that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=\r\nongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=\r\nistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=\r\nrgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =\r\nplanned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=\r\nbia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.\r\n\r\n?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=\r\ny recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =\r\nreports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=\r\ned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=\r\nsult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=\r\nted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=\r\neir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=\r\n that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=\r\n as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=\r\ngration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=\r\nity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her \"regi=\r\nstration\" documentation with them at all times.

The deals that Ann sent to me were not changed because the counterparty name was not set up and address information was not sent to me with the corrected confirmations.    These were sent back to Ann.  As far as I know the Trader did not give me any information on the counterparty name and address information..  If you have received this information on your end then I would suggest that you send in a GCP request so that Global Counterparty can set the counterparty up in the database.  Once this is done then you would need to send Sean the deal numbers that need to be changed.\n\nVladi, should the counterparty name be Coral Canada US, Inc.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \u0009Dozier, Scott  \nSent:\u0009Monday, October 08, 2001 10:16 AM\nTo:\u0009Riordan, Sean\nCc:\u0009Hernandez, Elizabeth L.; Pimenov, Vladi\nSubject:\u0009Deal Confirm for Coral Energy Canada\n\nSean,\n\nElizabeth should be familiar with what I will be refering to in this note, so please reference her if need be...\n\nThere are several ENA sales for Sep-01 production to Coral Energy Canada, Inc. which the counterparty is claiming should be billed under Coral Canada US, Inc.  The counterparty will not pay on these items until corrected.  In fact, the counterparty faxed back our confirmation with the requested change back in September.  Ann (I don't know eher last name) with ENA physical confirmations said that she was aware of these confirmations and that they had been forwarded to Elizabeth for her attention.  It is my understanding that once noted that there was actually no counterparty in our systems under this new name, the traders for each company should have been in contact to straighten this out.  I am unaware of that occuring or even if that is the correct procedure.\n\nI am cc'ing Vladi Pimenov because Sitara shows him as having created at least one of the deals.  Maybe he can clarify things for us.  One example of such deals is 1026087.  Bottom line is I need a way of receiving payment from Coral on these items.\n\nAll - please advise.\n\nScott Dozier\nClient Services - Settlements\nEnron Net Works LLC\noffice: 713.345.7213\nfax: 713.646.8420\nemail: scott.dozier@enron.com","headers":{"Date":"Thu, 11 Oct 2001 05:51:10 -0700 (PDT)","From":"scott.dozier@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c28108400.1075863463587.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"RE: Deal Confirm for Coral Energy Canada","To":"vladi.pimenov@enron.com","X-From":"Dozier, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SDOZIER\u003e","X-To":"Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vpimenov\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":"Valderrama, Lisa \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lvalde2\u003e, Hernandez, Elizabeth L. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ehernan\u003e, Riordan, Sean \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sriordan\u003e"},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"inbox"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbdd1e2d32371058b32"},"body":"There is no counterparty set up in the system as Coral Canada US, Inc.   The deals that Ann sent to me were not changed because the counterparty name was not set up and address information was not sent to me with the corrected confirmations.    These were sent back to Ann.  As far as I know the Trader did not give me any information on the counterparty name and address information..  If you have received this information on your end then I would suggest that you send in a GCP request so that Global Counterparty can set the counterparty up in the database.  Once this is done then you would need to send Sean the deal numbers that need to be changed.\n\nVladi, should the counterparty name be Coral Canada US, Inc.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \u0009Dozier, Scott  \nSent:\u0009Monday, October 08, 2001 10:16 AM\nTo:\u0009Riordan, Sean\nCc:\u0009Hernandez, Elizabeth L.; Pimenov, Vladi\nSubject:\u0009Deal Confirm for Coral Energy Canada\n\nSean,\n\nElizabeth should be familiar with what I will be refering to in this note, so please reference her if need be...\n\nThere are several ENA sales for Sep-01 production to Coral Energy Canada, Inc. which the counterparty is claiming should be billed under Coral Canada US, Inc.  The counterparty will not pay on these items until corrected.  In fact, the counterparty faxed back our confirmation with the requested change back in September.  Ann (I don't know eher last name) with ENA physical confirmations said that she was aware of these confirmations and that they had been forwarded to Elizabeth for her attention.  It is my understanding that once noted that there was actually no counterparty in our systems under this new name, the traders for each company should have been in contact to straighten this out.

The information provided below is subject to change for numerous \nreasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and \ndecisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure \nevents, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update \nit periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that \nthe specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the \nspecified dates. \n\nSUBJECT:   2002 TENTATIVE OUTAGE SCHEDULE\n\nIn February 2002, Columbia's Line BM-22 in Martin Co., KY will be out of \nservice due to Highway relocation for three (3) days resulting in a reduction \nof approximately 23,000 Dth/d of production flowing through Kermit Compressor. \nThis includes the following lines: P-94, V-55 and BM-18.   \n\nIn the spring of 2002, contingent upon the mining activity, Columbia's Line KA \nwill be out of service for three (3) days due to a coal mining relocation tie \nin.  Approximately 100,000 Dth/d of Appalachian production west of the May Fork \nvalve on Line KA will be shut in.\n\nIn the spring of 2002, Columbia's Boldman Compressor located in Pike Co., KY, \nwill have one unit down for approximately two (2) months for annual maintenance \nwhich results in a 15,000 Dth/d flow reduction.  Affected is Equitable's Hi-Hat \n(F3) pipeline, CNR's Boldman (CNR02) pipeline, and Appalachian production \nlocated on Columbia's Lines PM-3 and PM-17.\n\nIn May-June 2002, Columbia's Line's BM-18, Line VM-141 and Line V-55 will be \nout of service for five (5) days due to a relocation for WV Rt. 52 in Mingo \nCo., WV.  The affect, if any, on production is being evaluated.   \n\nIn July 2002, Line 1711 will be out of service for three (3) days due to a \nrelocation of the Monongahela River crossing tie in.  The affect, if any, on \nproduction is being evaluated.\n\nThe following outages affect Equitable's Beaver Creek (H1) pipeline, and \nAppalachian production from Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station to Columbia's \nHuff Creek Compressor Station on Line KA, including Line KA-15.\n\nIn March 2002, Columbia anticipates an outage of three (3) days on Columbia's \nLine SM-116 as a result of coal mining activity.  In addition to the above \nlisted production, Conoco's Grant (P1) pipeline and Appalachian production \nlocated on Line SM-116 will be affected. \n\nIn June 2002, Columbia's Grant Compressor located in Mingo Co., WV will have \none unit out of service for six (6) days which will result in a 50,000 Dth/d \nflow reduction.\n\nIn August 2002, Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor located in Wyoming Co., WV \nwill be out of service for one (1) week due to annual maintenance.\n\nIn the fall of 2002, Columbia's Line KA will be out of service for three (3) \ndays due to relocation for a highway expansion project on Rt. 119.   The \nrelocation is between Johns Creek and Canada, which will result in 100,000 \nDth/d of production shut in west of the May Fork valve setting.   \n\n","headers":{"Date":"Mon, 8 Oct 2001 06:31:08 -0700 (PDT)","From":"victor.lamadrid@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c25738810.1075863461054.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FW: TCO - 2002 TENTATIVE OUTAGE SCHEDULE","To":"chuck.ames@enron.com, f..brawner@enron.com, chris.germany@enron.com, \r\n\u0009scott.goodell@enron.com, john.hodge@enron.com, f..keavey@enron.com, \r\n\u0009brad.mckay@enron.com, jonathan.mckay@enron.com, scott.neal@enron.com, \r\n\u0009w..pereira@enron.com, vladi.pimenov@enron.com, andrea.ring@enron.com, \r\n\u0009leonidas.savvas@enron.com, maureen.smith@enron.com, \r\n\u0009craig.taylor@enron.com, judy.townsend@enron.com, \r\n\u0009victoria.versen@enron.com, w..vickers@enron.com","X-From":"Lamadrid, Victor \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=VLAMADR\u003e","X-To":"Ames, Chuck \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cames\u003e, Brawner, Sandra F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbrawne\u003e, Germany, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgerman\u003e, Goodell, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgoodel\u003e, Hodge, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhodge2\u003e, Keavey, Peter F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pkeavey\u003e, Mckay, Brad \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bmckay\u003e, Mckay, Jonathan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmckay1\u003e, Neal, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sneal\u003e, Pereira, Susan W. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spereir\u003e, Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vpimenov\u003e, Ring, Andrea \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aring\u003e, Savvas, Leonidas \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lsavvas\u003e, Smith, Maureen \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mgreena\u003e, Taylor, Craig \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtaylo2\u003e, Townsend, Judy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtownse\u003e, Versen, Victoria \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vversen\u003e, Vickers, Frank W. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Fvicker\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":"Allwein, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rallwei\u003e, Alvarado, Kevin \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kalvarad\u003e, Arteaga, Airam \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aarteag\u003e, Boudreaux, Shanna \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sboudrea\u003e, Carter, Tamara \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tcarter4\u003e, Collins, Joann \u003cJoann.Collins@ENRON.com\u003e, Garcia, Clarissa \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgarcia\u003e, Gillespie, Steve \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgillesp\u003e, Halstead, Lia \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lhalstea\u003e, Homco, Meredith \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mmitch2\u003e, Loocke, Kelly \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kloocke\u003e, Loving, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sloving\u003e, Ordway, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cordway\u003e, Prudenti, Dan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dprudent\u003e, Ramirez, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rramire3\u003e, Sanchez, Christina \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Csanche\u003e, Wood, Tracy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Twood2\u003e"},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

The monsignor replied,\n\"When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka\nnext to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.\"  So next\nSunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon,\nhe got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.  Upon his\nreturn to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:\n\n1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.\n2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.\n3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.\n4.

The information provided below is subject to change for numerous\nreasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and\ndecisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure\nevents, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update\nit periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that\nthe specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the\nspecified dates.\n\nSUBJECT:   2002 TENTATIVE OUTAGE SCHEDULE\n\nIn February 2002, Columbia's Line BM-22 in Martin Co., KY will be out of\nservice due to Highway relocation for three (3) days resulting in a reduction\nof approximately 23,000 Dth/d of production flowing through Kermit Compressor.\nThis includes the following lines: P-94, V-55 and BM-18.\n\nIn the spring of 2002, contingent upon the mining activity, Columbia's Line KA\nwill be out of service for three (3) days due to a coal mining relocation tie\nin.  Approximately 100,000 Dth/d of Appalachian production west of the May Fork\nvalve on Line KA will be shut in.\n\nIn the spring of 2002, Columbia's Boldman Compressor located in Pike Co., KY,\nwill have one unit down for approximately two (2) months for annual maintenance\nwhich results in a 15,000 Dth/d flow reduction.  Affected is Equitable's Hi-Hat\n(F3) pipeline, CNR's Boldman (CNR02) pipeline, and Appalachian production\nlocated on Columbia's Lines PM-3 and PM-17.\n\nIn May-June 2002, Columbia's Line's BM-18, Line VM-141 and Line V-55 will be\nout of service for five (5) days due to a relocation for WV Rt. 52 in Mingo\nCo., WV.  The affect, if any, on production is being evaluated.\n\nIn July 2002, Line 1711 will be out of service for three (3) days due to a\nrelocation of the Monongahela River crossing tie in.  The affect, if any, on\nproduction is being evaluated.\n\nThe following outages affect Equitable's Beaver Creek (H1) pipeline, and\nAppalachian production from Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station to Columbia's\nHuff Creek Compressor Station on Line KA, including Line KA-15.\n\nIn March 2002, Columbia anticipates an outage of three (3) days on Columbia's\nLine SM-116 as a result of coal mining activity.  In addition to the above\nlisted production, Conoco's Grant (P1) pipeline and Appalachian production\nlocated on Line SM-116 will be affected.\n\nIn June 2002, Columbia's Grant Compressor located in Mingo Co., WV will have\none unit out of service for six (6) days which will result in a 50,000 Dth/d\nflow reduction.\n\nIn August 2002, Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor located in Wyoming Co., WV\nwill be out of service for one (1) week due to annual maintenance.\n\nIn the fall of 2002, Columbia's Line KA will be out of service for three (3)\ndays due to relocation for a highway expansion project on Rt. 119.   The\nrelocation is between Johns Creek and Canada, which will result in 100,000\nDth/d of production shut in west of the May Fork valve setting.\n\n","headers":{"Date":"Mon, 8 Oct 2001 01:59:13 -0700 (PDT)","From":"navigator@nisource.com","Message-ID":"\u003c9837778.1075863461124.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"TCO - 2002 TENTATIVE OUTAGE SCHEDULE","To":"navigator@nisource.com","X-From":"navigator@nisource.com@ENRON","X-To":"navigator@nisource.com","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

Enron executives in our very own country are living at or \n\u003e just below the seven-figure salary level...right here in the land of \n\u003e plenty. And, as if that weren't bad enough, they will be deprived of it as\n\u003e a \n\u003e result of the bankruptcy and current SEC investigation. \n\u003e \n\u003e But now, you can help! For only $20,835 a month, about $694.50 a day\n\u003e (that's \n\u003e less than the cost of a large screen projection TV) you can help an Enron \n\u003e executive remain economically viable during his time of need. \n\u003e \n\u003e This contribution by no means solves the problem, as it barely covers the \n\u003e per diem, ...but it's a start! \n\u003e \n\u003e Now $700 may not seem like a lot of money to you, but to an Enron exec it \n\u003e could mean the difference between a vacation spent sucking ass in DC, \n\u003e golfing in Florida or on a Mediterranean cruise. \n\u003e \n\u003e For you, seven hundred dollars is nothing more than rent, a car note or \n\u003e mortgage payments. But to an Enron exec $700 will almost replace his or\n\u003e her \n\u003e per diem. \n\u003e \n\u003e Your commitment of less than $700 a day will enable an Enron exec to buy \n\u003e that home entertainment center, trade in the year-old Lexus for a new \n\u003e Ferrari, or enjoy a weekend in Rio. \n\u003e \n\u003e HOW WILL I KNOW I'M HELPING? \n\u003e Each month, you will receive a complete financial report on the exec you \n\u003e sponsor. Detailed information about his or her stocks, bonds, 401(k), real\n\u003e \n\u003e estate, and other investment holdings will be mailed to your home. \n\u003e \n\u003e You'll also get information on how he plans to invest his golden\n\u003e parachute. \n\u003e Imagine the joy as you watch your executive's portfolio double or triple! \n\u003e Plus upon signing up for this program, you will receive a photo (unsigned\n\u003e -- \n\u003e for a signed photo, please include an additional $50.00). Put the photo on\n\u003e \n\u003e your refrigerator to remind you of other peoples' suffering. \n\u003e \n\u003e HOW WILL HE KNOW I'M HELPING? \n\u003e Your Enron exec will be told that he has a SPECIAL FRIEND who just wants\n\u003e to \n\u003e help in a time of need.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbdd1e2d32371058b7c"},"body":"  \n[IMAGE]\nIntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce  that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These  fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average  temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week.  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange  website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather  stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International  and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. \nThe design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has  worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant  Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and  support for these new products.\nTo trade weather swaps you must have our new version 8 release installed on your system. An advisory  with details about this new release is being sent to you by separate email.  \nWe encourage all or our users to take a serious  look at the new weather products being offered by the IntercontinentalExchange.

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.\n\nAfter weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.\n\nKen Lay","headers":{"Date":"Mon, 19 Nov 2001 13:34:59 -0800 (PST)","From":"no.address@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c27381457.1075862462477.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Holiday Party - Canceled","X-From":"Ken Lay- Chairman of the Board \u0026 CEO@ENRON","X-To":"All Enron Houston@ENRON \u003c??SAll Enron Houston@ENRON\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. \n\nOccupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South\nYou will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.\n\nNEC Monitors\nThe NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.\n\nTurret Users\nAn \"Alliance MX turret quick reference guide\" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as \"Caller ID\" and \"Voicemail Indication\".\n\nIncreased Information Access\nThere are many NEC 50\" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:\n\nTen audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:\n \nChannel\u0009Avaya\u0009Stentophon\u0009\nWeather Channel\u000912401\u0009801\u0009\nCNN Headlines News\u000912402\u0009802\u0009\nCNN Financial News\u000912403\u0009803\u0009\nCNBC\u000912404\u0009804\u0009\nMSNBC\u000912405\u0009805\u0009\nBloomberg\u000912406\u0009806\u0009\nFinancial News Network\u000912407\u0009807\u0009\nCNN\u000912408\u0009808\u0009\nFox Sports\u000912409\u0009809\u0009\nESPN1\u000912410\u0009810\u0009\n\n\nWireless Telephony\nYou may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network \"in-building\" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  \n\nWireless LAN\nThe infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.\n\nAmtel Replacement\nAs a move to provide a more flexible \"Plug n Play\" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.

We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.\n\n?\u0009ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.\n?\u0009Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.\n\nWe regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.\n  ","headers":{"Date":"Wed, 21 Nov 2001 08:16:54 -0800 (PST)","From":"no.address@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c31566138.1075862463426.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Program Changes","X-From":"ClickAtHome and Community Relations-@ENRON","X-To":"All Enron Employees United States Group@ENRON \u003c??SAll Enron Employees United States Group@ENRON\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

We have discussed ENE's need to improve counter\nparty confidence on a number of occasions over the last few weeks, and we\nbelieve counter party confidence deteriorated further based on the\ninformation included in the 10Q, and the strong negative reaction in the\nstock and bond markets yesterday.  The tone of our discussions with\ncompeting traders and marketers (representative of ENE's counter\nparties--which are critical in maintaining ENE's volumes) is becoming more\nnegative.  While ENE is continuing to confirm that volumes are improving\nsince the lows on November 9, our market intelligence is suggesting\nimproment has stalled.  In addition and probably related, ENE's liquidity\nposition seems to be continuing to deteriorate despite significant recent\ncapital infusions.  We are reducing 4Q01 estimates to reflect lower volume\nand margin assumptions.  What would get us more comfortable?  ENE 8K\ndisclosure confirming higher volume and decent margins (ENE has committed\nto provide 4Q guidance by early-mid December, and/or a change in the tone\nof the counter parties that would suggest they are increasing trading\nactivities with ENE.\n\nOPINION ON THE STOCKS:\n   ENE.  No change in our opinion on ENE--the upside potential is simply\n   not worth the downside risk.\n   DYN.  DYN is likely to benefit in almost all outcomes.  If our concerns\n   about counter party confidence prove to be wrong, the upside associated\n   with the accretion in the transaction would likely be huge.  However, we\n   sense DYN is getting frustrated by continued restatement of earnings,\n   unexpected debt triggers and worse than expected liquidity problems.  If\n   the transaction falls apart, DYN would have some transaction costs that\n   would negatively impact cash flow in the near-term, but DYN would\n   benefit from gaining market share and hiring some of ENE's talent away\n   longer term.  A potential downside case for DYN is that DYN retrades the\n   deal on recent information, but is forced to reduced its flexibility to\n   terminate the transaction through material adverse change\n   considerations, this out come would concern us.  We continue to believe\n   DYN is a solid long-term holding for investors.  However, we are\n   recommending caution with new money, due to our belief that DYN still\n   has $5/sh to $7/sh of \"deal\" premium factored into the current stock\n   price which could be at risk if the deal fails.  We do not believe DYN\n   has significant accounts receivable exposure to ENE in the event the ENE\n   has further liquidity problems (we believe DYN's trading agreement with\n   ENE limits exposure to maybe $100 to $150 MM).\n\nCOUNTER PARTY INCENTIVES:  ENE identified in its 10Q that transaction\nvolume (especially long-term transactions) have declined since the 3Q.  If\nyou are a utility or industrial customer, why enter into a long-term\ntransaction with ENE?  Why not go directly to DYN or diversify with other\nsuppliers?  If you are a natural gas or power producer, why create the\naccount receivable risk?  If you are a counter party, strategically why\nwould you contribute to the continuation of the ENE machine--to the\nultimate benefit of strengthening another competitor (DYN)?  We believe\nthat ENE is offering attractive financial incentives (premium purchases\nand/or discounted sales) to entice counter parties to trade with them.\nHowever, this would also suggest ENE margins may be getting squeezed.\n\nEPS ESTIMATES (new/old/consensus):\n   4Q01-$0.20/0.35/0.42, FY01-$1.55/1.70/1.78, FY02-$1.50/1.50/1.90\n   We are reducing expectations for margins in the Wholesale segment from\n   9cts/mmbtu to 7cts/mmbtu--negatively impacting 4Q EPS by 10cts/sh.  In\n   addition, we expect contributions from Enron Energy Services will be\n   lower due to challenges in closing long-term transactions (much of EES's\n   earnings are mark-to-market recognition of the value created in\n   long-term agreeements) impacting our estimate by 5cts/sh.\n\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\nThis e-mail is based on information obtained from sources which Simmons \u0026\nCompany International believes to be reliable, but Simmons \u0026 Company\nInternational does not represent or warrant its accuracy.

This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:\n\nWholesale\n\nBob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. \n\nVictor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. \n\nLisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.\n\nPatti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.\n\nDarren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin \n\nGeorge Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  \n\nRetail \n\nDonna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  \n\n\nCongratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.\n _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nAssistants - Please forward on to your groups. \n\n\n","headers":{"Date":"Mon, 26 Nov 2001 06:52:54 -0800 (PST)","From":"kimberly.bates@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c14832017.1075862464104.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FW: Logistics Commercial Realignment","To":"chuck.ames@enron.com, f..brawner@enron.com, chris.germany@enron.com, \r\n\u0009john.hodge@enron.com, f..keavey@enron.com, brad.mckay@enron.com, \r\n\u0009jonathan.mckay@enron.com, scott.neal@enron.com, w..pereira@enron.com, \r\n\u0009vladi.pimenov@enron.com, andrea.ring@enron.com, \r\n\u0009leonidas.savvas@enron.com, judy.townsend@enron.com, \r\n\u0009victoria.versen@enron.com, robin.barbe@enron.com, \r\n\u0009ruth.concannon@enron.com, scott.goodell@enron.com, \r\n\u0009david.jones@enron.com, jared.kaiser@enron.com, \r\n\u0009scott.loving@enron.com, gil.muhl@enron.com, maureen.smith@enron.com, \r\n\u0009shauywn.smith@enron.com, craig.taylor@enron.com, \r\n\u0009jim.willis@enron.com, t..zivley@enron.com","X-From":"Bates, Kimberly \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=KBATES\u003e","X-To":"Ames, Chuck \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cames\u003e, Brawner, Sandra F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbrawne\u003e, Germany, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgerman\u003e, Hodge, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhodge2\u003e, Keavey, Peter F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pkeavey\u003e, Mckay, Brad \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bmckay\u003e, Mckay, Jonathan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmckay1\u003e, Neal, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sneal\u003e, Pereira, Susan W. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spereir\u003e, Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vpimenov\u003e, Ring, Andrea \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aring\u003e, Savvas, Leonidas \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lsavvas\u003e, Townsend, Judy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtownse\u003e, Versen, Victoria \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vversen\u003e, Barbe, Robin \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbarbe\u003e, Concannon, Ruth \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rconcan\u003e, Goodell, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgoodel\u003e, Jones, David \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Djones8\u003e, Kaiser, Jared \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jkaiser\u003e, Loving, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sloving\u003e, Muhl, Gil \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gmuhl\u003e, Smith, Maureen \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mgreena\u003e, Smith, Shauywn \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ssmith22\u003e, Taylor, Craig \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtaylo2\u003e, Willis, Jim \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jwillis3\u003e, Zivley, Jill T. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jzivley\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

This system-wide warning is issued as a\nresult of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual\ndeliveries.\n\nWeather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and\nshippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation\nof the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern?s\nstorage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is\nvirtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system\noperational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual\nimbalances left on the system.\n\nBecause of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas\nEastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being\nleft on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate\nwith their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to\nmatch actual customer takes in the market area.\n\nIf immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of\ngas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an\noperational flow order (OFO) requiring actual receipts of gas to match\nactual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO\nnon-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as\nprovided for in Texas Easterns FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take\nany other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its\nsystem, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*******************************************************************\n\nNOTE:\n\nDuke Energy Gas Transmission respects your online time and privacy.\nYou have received this email because you elected to subscribe.

Any decreases in gas\nreceipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2\nParties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city-\ngate markets.  This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is\napplicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points.  All\nrequests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be\naccepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  After Texas Eastern?s\noperational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will\nnotify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a\nreasonable time to come back into balance.  Any TABS-2 party willing to\ndecrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account\nManager.\n\n\n\n\n*******************************************************************\n\nNOTE:\n\nDuke Energy Gas Transmission respects your online time and privacy.\nYou have received this email because you elected to subscribe.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058bac"},"body":"To All Employees:\n\nThis morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:\n\n-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.\n\n\n-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.\n\n-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.\n\n-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.\n\nThese are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.\n\nAs you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.\n\nFor our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.\n\nI know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  \u003chttp://home.enron.com\u003e. We will also have a Q\u0026A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.\n\nWhen decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.\n\nOn behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.\n\nKen","headers":{"Date":"Sun, 2 Dec 2001 15:52:55 -0800 (PST)","From":"chairman.ken@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c18978289.1075841408194.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Enron Files Chapter 11 Reorganization","To":"dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide5@enron.com","X-From":"Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MBX_KLAYOFFICECHAIR\u003e","X-To":"DL-GA-ALL_enron_worldwide5 \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DL-GA-ALL-5\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"inbox"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058bad"},"body":"\nMany of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.\n\nI still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.\n\nWe are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.\n\nWhile terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.\n\nI appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.\n\nKen","headers":{"Date":"Fri, 30 Nov 2001 15:58:13 -0800 (PST)","From":"no.address@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c33239291.1075841408221.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","X-From":"Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman@ENRON","X-To":"All Enron Employees United States Group@ENRON","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"inbox"}

The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:\n\n?\u0009Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  \n\n?\u0009After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.\n\n?\u0009The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  \n\nTo move funds:\nOn the Web, choose \"Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation\" from the drop down menu.\nOn Voice Response, choose \"request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.\"\nThis will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.\n\nTo avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.","headers":{"Date":"Thu, 29 Nov 2001 17:27:25 -0800 (PST)","From":"no.address@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c31616268.1075841408481.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON\r\n SAVINGS PLAN","X-From":"Corporate Benefits@ENRON","X-To":"All US DOMESTIC \u0026 EXPAT EMPLOYEES@ENRON","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"inbox"}

Once the H-1 is out of status, in theory, s/he is technically\nrequired to depart the US as soon as possible.  If the H-1 can find a new\nemployer and file within approximately 30 to 60 days from the date of\ntermination, the INS has generally overlooked the violation of the\nmaintenance of status.  Keep in mind this is not a hard and fast rule, and\nthe INS has the ability to enforce shorter or longer periods on a\ncase-by-case basis.  Enron has generally waited 60 days prior to information\nthe INS of foreign nationals termination in order to allow foreign nationals\nto take advantage of this informal INS policy.\n\nIf you are currently an H-1B nonimmigrant in the US and you have not\nviolated your status, such as by beginning work for a different employer,\nthen you may likely be able to take advantage of a new \"portability\"\nprovision in the 2000 amendments to the Immigration \u0026 Nationality Act.  This\nallows for the new prospective employer to file an amended H-1B petition and\nfor the H-1B Temporary Worker to begin working with the new employer once\nthe petition is filed, rather than having to wait several months for the\ncase to be approved prior to transferring to the new employer.\n\nYou should likely meet with an immigration attorney in person as soon as\npossible after being laid off so that you are advised of all the possible\noptions that may be open to you.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Daffin, Margaret [mailto:Margaret.Daffin@ENRON.com]\nSent: Wednesday, November 28, 2001 4:23 PM\nTo: Alice Gruber\nCc: Susan King\nSubject: FW:\n\n\nAlice:  do you have any answer for this one?\nMargaret\n\n\n\u003e  -----Original Message-----\n\u003e From: \u0009Reyes, Pauline\n\u003e Sent:\u0009Wednesday, November  28, 2001 2:06 PM\n\u003e To:\u0009Daffin, Margaret\n\u003e Subject:\n\u003e\n\u003e Margaret,\n\u003e\n\u003e In a bankruptcy situation, will lawyers provide H-1 grace period?

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058bc4"},"body":"\nAs you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.\n\nEven though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.\n\nIn addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.\n\nIf you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

The deal includes an immediate infusion\nof $1.5 billion from Dynegy's 26.6% owner ChevronTexaco to shore up Enron's\ncash-strained trading operations, with another $1 billion of new equity from\nChevronTexaco when the merger closes.\n\n\"We view both the near and long-term upside potential of this deal as\nstaggering,\" said the UBS Warburg analysts, citing the combination of\n\"Enron's unsurpassed global wholesale network franchise with that of\nDynegy's; fully leveraging the two's online capabilities; continuing the\naggressive growth of what will likely become Dynegy Energy Services;\ndisposing of all non-core assets; and managing this global powerhouse with\nDynegy's above-board culture based on teamwork, strict values and honesty.\"\n\nEven though it remains positive about this merger, UBS Warburg hasn't\nunderestimated the \"enormous challenge at hand. In the near-term, Enron must\nremain highly liquid, investment grade and its employees must remain focused\non keeping its core wholesale/retail franchises up and running. ... Also,\nearly indications are that the ratings agencies have blessed the plan.\"\n\nDynegy will offer 0.2685 of its shares for each Enron share, giving Dynegy\nholders 64% of the combined company. At Dynegy's closing price Friday of\n$38.76/share, that equates to $10.41/share for Enron, which has seen its\nstock plummet from more than $89 a year ago to a recent low of $7 before\nrebounding on Dynegy bailout rumors. Enron closed at $8.63/share Nov. 9.\n\n\nDynegy Calls SEC's Probe of Enron `Financial Noise'\nBy Russell Hubbard \n\nHouston, Nov. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. Chairman Chuck Watson said he's convinced Enron Corp.'s trading operations are sound and described disclosures about affiliated partnerships that helped drive Enron's stock down 67 percent in three weeks as ``financial noise.'' \n\nDynegy agreed Friday to buy Enron for at least $23 billion, including at least $8 billion in stock and $15 billion in assumed debt. Dynegy shares rose as much as 16 percent today. Enron rose as much as 20 percent. \n\nIn an interview after the merger announcement, Watson and Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay discussed how the Houston-based companies reached agreement less than three weeks after Enron's shares began plunging. \n\n``All the financial noise about the partnerships, maybe it has damaged the Enron brand a bit,'' Watson said. ``But I'll tell you what it hasn't impacted, and that's the high regard that the industry places on'' Enron's trading business, he said. \n\nEnron last week restated earnings for four years to include losses from three affiliated partnerships, reducing earnings by $586 million. \n\nSix employees, out of Enron's 20,000, may have improperly benefited from the partnerships, Lay said. \n\n``I'm sorry those six people seem to have gone somewhat over the edge in their dealings or transactions, but you can't be absolutely protected from that in any business,'' he said. \n\nLost Effectiveness \n\nLay didn't specify which six people he was referring to. He removed Andrew Fastow, who helped set up and ran many of the affiliated partnerships, as chief financial officer on Oct. 24. An Enron securities filing says Fastow made more than $30 million off two of the partnerships. \n\nFastow ``had lost his effectiveness because of all the press coverage'' on the affiliates, Lay said. \n\nTreasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing director and a corporate counsel for an Enron division, also were fired, Enron said in a corporate filing on Thursday. Former employees Michael Kopper, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager were in a position to profit from partnerships, the filing said. \n\n``You trust people, you accept their representations and proposals,'' Lay said. ``Sometimes when you do that, you get surprised and disappointed.'' \n\nBoth executives said they expect antitrust regulators to approve the merger because the two companies own different types of assets and won't dominate any market. \n\n``There really isn't anything that lays on top of each other,'' Watson said Friday night. ``We're not in the pipeline business and they are. We're in the generation business, and they're really not.'' \n\nDynegy shares rose 6.2 percent on Friday after terms of the Enron purchase leaked to the press. Watson expects the acquisition to add 90 cents to 95 cents a share, or 35 percent, to Dynegy's 2002 earnings. Enron is selling for $10.41 a share, one-fifth the average price over the past 12 months. \n\nEnron stock climbed 97 cents, or 11 percent, to $9.60 in late morning trading. Earlier, they touched $10.38. Dynegy rose $4.54, or 12 percent, to $43.30 after touching $45. \n\nCash Crunch \n\nThe rapid decline of Enron threatened to bankrupt the company and disrupt energy markets. Enron handles an estimated one-quarter of U.S. electricity and natural-gas trades. A falling credit rating made it difficult for the company to raise capital needed to back trades. \n\nAs part of the purchase, ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, agreed to provide Enron with $2.5 billion. \n\n``What we found when looked under the hood is that the core of Enron was still there and working as well as ever,'' Watson said. ``That business was pristine and had nothing to do with the partnerships.'' \n\nDynegy began taking steps toward the acquisition in late October, when Watson called Lay to offer assistance with Enron's growing financial crisis, the two men said. That led to a Saturday morning meeting in Lay's kitchen. \n\n``He even made me a breakfast roll,'' Watson said. \n\n``He didn't eat it,'' Lay said. \n\nLay said he won't be an active manager in the new company. Watson said Friday that he and Lay hadn't discussed a severance package. \n\nAs head of Enron, Lay had refocused the Houston operator of U.S. natural-gas pipelines on trading and international expansion, boosting reported revenue 20-fold since 1995 to $100.8 billion last year. He said he doesn't regret the strategy. \n\n``Clearly, Enron has gotten involved in business that hasn't turned out well,'' Lay said, pointing to money-losers Azurix Inc., created to supply water and build related projects around the world, and NewPower Holdings Inc., a seller of electricity to homes and small businesses. ``But you have to keep in mind, too, that 12 years ago we weren't in the wholesale merchant (trading) business. Today that's an incredibly valuable franchise.'' \n\nThe trading business, which accounts for about 97 percent of Enron's revenue, buys electricity, gas and other commodities from producers and sells them to end users such as utilities and industrial customers. It also advises big business customers on energy use and sells them gas and electricity. \n\nReassessing Steel, Lumber \n\nWatson said the new company will keep trading coal, gas, power and petroleum products, and plans to expand by buying assets and using them to develop trading. ``We'll just have to reassess over time whether we stay in'' trading of steel, lumber and other non-energy commodities, he said. \n\nEnron wants to shed its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power Co. in India, which is owed $64 million in overdue bills from a state government agency that has refused to pay the power prices Enron was promised in contracts. \n\n``We have strong legal remedies and we're heading down the path toward arbitration, but we'd still very much like to work out a settlement with the government,'' Lay said. Potential buyers have balked at Enron's $1 billion asking price for Dabhol. \n\nNeither man would comment on whether Dynegy plans to cut jobs after the merger, or what will happen to the naming rights to Enron Field. The Major League baseball stadium is home to the Houston Astros, and Enron paid $100 million to have its name on the ballpark. \n\n``The name of the company is now Dynegy,'' Watson said. \n\nDynegy's acquisition requires approval from U.S. securities, antitrust and energy regulators. Watson expects soon to share details of the new Dynegy with regulators from the European Union and U.K., where Enron operates a trading desk and owns a water company and two power plants. \n\n``I don't know if we are required to do so, but we will talk to them anyway,'' Watson said. \n\n``We don't think there are going to be any problems,'' Lay said. \n\n \n\nDynegy sees no more nasty surprises from Enron.\nBy Andrew Kelly\n11/12/2001 \nReuters English News Service\nHOUSTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Dynegy Inc. said on Monday does not foresee any damaging disclosures from Enron Corp., slammed by news of murky off-balance sheet transactions, that could derail its planned takeover of the beleaguered energy trading giant. \nHowever, Dynegy said it can drop its $9 billion offer if more bad news emerges, or if pending lawsuits against Enron lead to more than $3.5 billion in costs.\nDynegy also expressed confidence the takeover announced on Friday, will win U.S. regulatory approval. \n\"I really have a good deal of confidence, but not an absolute guarantee, that we are going to be fine here,\" said Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson, when pressed about the possibility of further troubling disclosures by Enron. \nWatson said Dynegy had run the deal through worst-case scenarios and concluded that it made good business sense. \nInvestors apparently agreed, bidding up Dynegy shares $5.55, or 14.3 percent, to close at $44.31 on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron shares gained 61 cents, to 7.1 percent, to $9.24. The deal valued Enron stock at $10.41. \nEnron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe into the off-balance sheet dealings, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit rating downgrades. \nWatson has cause for concern about new disclosures from Enron, which last Thursday said an internal probe showed its earnings had been overstated by some $600 million since 1997. \nIn a conference call with analysts on Monday, Dynegy executives emphasized their confidence in the future of the combined company, including annual projected earnings-per-share growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next three years. \nBut they also fielded a barrage of questions about how well Dynegy has insulated itself against further surprises of the kind that had slashed Enron's market value last week to barely one-tenth the almost $80 billion it was valued in August 2000. \nDYNEGY DOUBTS HUGE LIABILITIES \nTo ensure against unpleasant disclosures, Dynegy wrote so-called material adverse change clauses into the deal, allowing it to walk away from Enron if there is serious deterioration of its businesses or assets. \nIn particular, Dynegy can turn its back on the deal if pending litigation against Enron - including a stack of lawsuits filed by angry investors who have lost a fortune - leads to costs of more than $3.5 billion. \nChief Financial Officer Rob Doty said it was highly unlikely that this threshold would be reached, even if a \"very substantial\" settlement was reached in the stockholder suits. \nCommerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said he was not yet convinced that the stream of bad news from Enron was over. \n\"I think Dynegy is making a big bet that they can successfully clean up the problems that Enron has had,\" he said. \nBut UBS Warburg analyst Jay Yannello said after hearing management discuss the deal, he was reassured it could address tough questions - a breath of fresh air after Enron's tight-lipped response to investors. \nSome analysts have said the deal could be thwarted by regulators because of concerns that Dynegy would be too powerful after merging with Enron, currently North America's biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity. \nWatson said Dynegy would have to work hard to explain the deal to regulators, led by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but does not doubt it will eventually pass muster. \n\"We really are confident that up and down the line we are going to be able to convince them that this is really in the best interest of the energy industry as well as these two respective companies,\" he said. \nGAS PIPELINE OPTION, BREAK-UP FEES \nDynegy executives also said there would be no complicated financing arrangements of the kind that triggered Enron's downfall, and that the new Dynegy will be able to keep top Enron executives and traders from defecting to rival firms. \nEnron officials declined to comment on reports that its banks J.P. Morgan and Citigroup were considering pumping an extra $500 million of capital in to Enron. \nOil company ChevronTexaco Inc., a major Dynegy stockholder, has already agreed to inject $1.5 billion into Enron immediately to keep it afloat while the merger is completed, which Dynegy expects to take six to nine months. \nIf Enron backs out of the deal to accept a higher offer, it would have to pay a $350 million breakup fee to Dyegy. \nAnd if the deal breaks down for any reason, Dynegy would be allowed to exercise an option to acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline subsidiary.\nDynegy and Enron Shares Get a Boost As Acquisition Plan is Met With Optimism\nBy John R. Emshwiller\n11/13/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal\nThe shares of Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc. both rose in heavy trading as investors began trying to digest the possible risks and rewards of Dynegy's plan to acquire Enron in a stock swap with a current value of $10.12 billion. \nIn calls and meetings with analysts yesterday, Dynegy Chairman Chuck Watson and Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay continued talking up the deal that was announced late Friday. \"We are confident this is good strategically and financially for Dynegy and Enron,\" said Mr. Watson, who will serve as chairman and chief executive of the combined entity, to be called Dynegy Inc.\nWhile the proposed combination faces months of review by government agencies and gives Dynegy possible opportunities to cancel the deal, investors' initial reaction to the merger announcement was positive. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Dynegy shares were at $44.31, up $5.55, or 14%. Also on the Big Board, Enron was at $9.24, up 7.1%, or 61 cents. Both companies were among the most actively traded issues. \nUnder terms of the proposed acquisition, Dynegy would give 0.2685 of its shares for each Enron share. Based on Dynegy's stock price yesterday , this formula values Enron stock at $11.90 each. Enron has about 850 million shares outstanding. \nSome people raised cautionary notes yesterday. Moody's Investors Service placed Dynegy on review for a possible credit-ratings downgrade. Standard \u0026 Poor's made a similar move on Friday. Moody's said that while it saw positive elements to the proposed combination, it also believed \"the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegy's credit fundamentals.\" \nPrudential Securities analyst Carol Coale, who counts herself a fan of Dynegy, also worries that Enron's enormous problems could be a drag on the combined entity. \"I don't want the Dynegy folks to get into something that's not good for the company,\" she said. \nAs reported, Enron in the past several weeks has seen its stock price and standing in the investment community plummet, largely as the result of large-scale transactions it did with partnerships headed by Enron officers. Those transactions have produced hundreds of millions of dollars of write-offs and restatements in the past month. They are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and have helped spawn more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits.\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones \u0026 Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \u0009\n\n\nGas Pipeline Is Prominent As Dynegy Seeks Enron\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\n11/13/2001\nThe New York Times\nDynegy has negotiated a great takeover. And it may end up buying Enron, too. \nAs part of its planned acquisition of Enron, Dynegy will get the crown jewel even if the overall deal falls apart. In return for its $1.5 billion investment today, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline system that is probably worth more.\nAs Dynegy stock soared 14 percent yesterday, Enron's lagged behind, rising just 7 percent. [Page C13.] \nThat widened the spread -- the profit a trader could lock in by buying Enron and selling Dynegy short, assuming the deal goes through -- to 28 percent. \nThe big premium probably reflects more than the fact that this deal will not close for many months. It is at least a possibility that Dynegy will renegotiate the price, or even walk away, as it learns more about Enron's business. \nNot that Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive of Dynegy, was threatening to do any such thing. In a talk to analysts yesterday, and in a later interview, he was extraordinarily upbeat about Enron's trading business even as he dismissed many of the company's diversifications as failures whose poor performance might have been obscured by fancy accounting. \nFull details of the agreement between the companies will not be known until the merger agreement is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today or tomorrow. But it appears that if the agreement falls apart for any reason, Dynegy has the right to keep the pipeline without putting up any additional cash. \nSpeaking to analysts yesterday, Rob Doty, chief financial officer at Dynegy, said the company was paying about seven or eight times the cash flow of the pipeline business. \nWalking away from the deal might cost Dynegy $350 million if it could not cite any material adverse change in Enron's business, as provided in the merger agreement. But one way to look at this deal is that Dynegy is spending $1.85 billion for the pipeline and a right to get the rest of Enron on the agreed terms. \nMr. Watson said he was confident that things would not go wrong. \n''We have comfort there is not another shoe to drop,'' he said. ''If there is no shoe, this is a phenomenally good transaction.'' \nIn presentations to analysts, Dynegy officials said they expected the company's earnings per share to grow by at least 90 cents a year even before considering cost reductions as the two businesses are merged. That arithmetic was based on assumptions that Enron could deliver at least 75 percent of the $2 a share in pro-forma earnings that Wall Street had been forecasting for next year. Those forecasts had stayed the same even as Enron's business collapsed. \nThe bullish case for the merger is that Enron's real profits were there and that the financial maneuvering did not cover up far deeper problems. \nMr. Watson promised that more details would be disclosed about the partnerships that were created by Enron and traded with it, providing a substantial part of the company's profits in 2000. \nEnron's need to make a deal quickly -- almost any deal -- was emphasized by Standard \u0026 Poor's, the bond rating service. In a conference call yesterday, Ron Barone, an analyst with S.\u0026 P., said that without the takeover, Enron's rating would have been cut to low BB or high B. Those ratings are not even at the high end of junk, and a company like Enron, which depends on others being willing to treat it as a trusted trading partner, needs an investment grade rating. Its current S.\u0026 P. rating is BBB minus, the lowest investment grade rating. \nThat means Enron could not continue as an independent business. And it means that should Dynegy decide to renegotiate, Enron would be in a very poor bargaining position unless it had another bidder.\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones \u0026 Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \u0009\n\n\n\nSuitor for Enron Receives Approval From Wall St.\nBy ALEX BERENSON\n11/13/2001\nThe New York Times\nWall Street found nothing but good news in Dynegy's $9 billion takeover of the Enron Corporation yesterday. \nThree days after Dynegy, an energy marketing and trading company based in Houston, agreed to take over Enron, its giant crosstown rival, Dynegy executives came to New York to assure investors that the deal would sharply increase their company's profits. They met a receptive audience.\nDynegy stock closed yesterday at $44.31, up $5.55, or 14.3 percent. Since last Wednesday, when news of a possible takeover emerged, Dynegy's stock has risen more than one-third. Enron closed at $9.24, up 61 cents, or 7.1 percent. \nAfter some initial uncertainty about the takeover, investors appear to have accepted Dynegy's view that the deal will give it a lucrative franchise in trading natural gas and electricity. Enron's stock fell almost 80 percent in the weeks leading up to the deal as Enron said it had overstated its earnings by almost $600 million since 1997 and forced out several top executives. \nBut Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman, told investors repeatedly yesterday that Enron's problems were mainly a result of failed expansion efforts. He largely dismissed the concerns of some short-sellers and analysts that Enron might be hiding losses at its core energy trading operations. \n''There's nothing wrong with Enron's business,'' Mr. Watson said in an interview at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel after making a lunchtime presentation to analysts and investors. ''The people in it ought to be really upset that for the last several years, they have produced earnings and cash that have been invested in other businesses that are not making money.'' \nEnron's immediate problem was a crisis of confidence, which could have caused other companies to stop trading with it, Mr. Watson said. A $1.5 billion cash infusion from Dynegy should restore the confidence of Enron's business partners and keep Enron stable until the takeover is complete, he said. To bolster Enron further, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup may each invest an additional $250 million, executives close to the deal said. The potential investments by J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup were reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. \nMr. Watson said Dynegy would also move quickly to assuage Enron employees who are angry that Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, and other top executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock in 2000 and this year as Enron's shares plunged. ''Right now, there's some animosity over there,'' he said. \nMany employees at Enron will get new grants of stock options when the acquisition is completed, he said. The company said it expected the deal to close by the end of the third quarter of next year, after extensive reviews from federal and state energy regulators and the Department of Justice. \nMr. Watson predicted that the deal would lift Dynegy's earnings by 90 cents or more a share next year, to more than $3.45 a share. \nAnalysts backed that view yesterday. ''Investments in noncore business distracted the attention of management and also took up capital,'' said Thomas Hamlin, an analyst at Wachovia Securities. Mr. Hamlin said he believed that Dynegy had obtained Enron, which reported more than $100 billion in revenue last year, for a bargain price. \n''It's not too often you get to take out the No. 7 Fortune 500 company and double your earnings in the meantime,'' he said. ''My guess is the stock is worth $70 per share.'' \nThe deal could increase Dynegy's earnings by $1 to $2 a share next year, said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at the Williams Capital Group. \n''That's a whopper,'' he said. ''It's a very good deal financially, certainly should be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-sheet backstop for Enron.'' \nMr. Lay said in an interview that Enron had been forced to sell itself because of ''the relentlessness of all the articles and the shorts.'' \n''We realized that we needed to do something to stabilize the ship,'' he said. ''A good company was being badly tarnished.''\nPhoto: In Houston, the headquarters building of Dynegy Inc., the energy and marketing trading company, which is in a $9 billion takeover of Enron.

Negative news on that front quickly surfaced Monday as at least two traders said they still plan extremely limited business with Enron. \nDynegy must also manage any unexpected disclosures about Enron's financial performance and investment partnerships, convince Enron's traders and other key employees to stick around, and mesh different corporate cultures. \nInvestors were optimistic in Dynegy's abilities as shares in the company traded up $5.55 to close at $44.31 Monday, while shares in Enron ended the day up 61 cents at $9.24. \nEnron has been under siege since Oct. 16 when it reported a $35 million loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity tied to business dealings with investment partnerships run by its then-chief financial officer. \nSince then, the Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation of Enron, a slew of shareholder lawsuits were filed and Enron's stock price plummeted. \nA new shareholder suit filed Monday included Dynegy on its list of defendants. \nLast week, Enron said it was restating its earnings back to 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships, including several being investigated by the SEC. It said it was correcting almost $600 million worth of mistakes. \nJust how close Enron was to a collapse remains unclear. One industry source believes Enron had been pushed \"to the brink\" and would have been done for if it had been unable to reach agreement with Dynegy last week. \nBut Ron Barone, a credit analyst with Standard \u0026 Poor's, doesn't think Enron's condition was so desperate. \n\"We clearly didn't see this as an imminent bankruptcy or imminent default, but it is something that could have eroded over time ... in a fairly short time.\" \nFriday, Enron's long-term debt rating was downgraded to one notch above investment-grade status by both Moody's Investors Service and S\u0026P. \nEnron is the largest natural gas and electricity trader in the nation, accounting for about 25 percent of all transactions. Its collapse would have meant the loss of much liquidity in the trading market, making trades more difficult and prices more volatile, industry experts said. \nDynegy announced a deal Friday to buy Enron at a fire-sale price of almost $9 billion in stock, plus the assumption of about $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. The merger is expected to close, barring holdups from regulators, in six to nine months. \nAs part of the agreement, Dynegy stakeholder ChevronTexaco is giving Dynegy $1.5 billion, which is to be infused today to help shore up Enron's liquidity and preserve its trading franchise. \nSome of Enron's former trading partners are still steering clear of the giant. \nTo facilitate transactions, the various energy trading firms extend credit to one another. Those agreements are contingent upon a partner maintaining an adequate rating. \nIf the credit rating firms had downgraded Enron's debt to junk status, its trading operation would have been devastated, industry officials said. \nAs details of Enron's questionable financial dealings have been revealed, Enron's trading partners have been scrambling to reduce their exposure. \nKansas City, Mo.-based Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., for instance, has been ratcheting down its activity with Enron, company spokesman Al Butkus said. \nBy the end of last week, Aquila's exposure to Enron was \"insignificant,\" Butkus said. \"And after all that was revealed on Friday and the downgrading of the credit, we are now at an even lower level.\" \nAtlanta-based Mirant has likewise reduced its exposure and is only doing a limited amount of business with Enron. \nSome larger players, however, continue doing deals with the company. \n\"Reliant Energy has consistently been trading with Enron through its difficulties, albeit with a heightened sense of caution,\" said Shahid Malik, president of Houston-based Reliant Energy's trading operation. \nCharlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy's exposure stands at $100 million. \n\"We're continuing the way we have been,\" said Duke spokesman Terry Francisco. \nJohn Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Houston, predicted it would take the traders some time to digest the merger deal. \n\"I think people will increasingly come back to Enron just as soon as the $1.5 billion changes hands,\" he said. \nTraders still have incentives to do business with Enron even though it's being sold, as it has a wider variety of products than some of its competitors and its EnronOnline Internet trading operation is regarded as superior. \nOn a conference call with investors and analysts Monday morning, Dynegy and Enron executives fielded a variety of questions about the merger but refused comment on a Wall Street Journal report that J.P. Morgan Chase \u0026 Co. and Citigroup are considering a $500 million investment in Enron. \nAnalysts remain worried that new and troubling surprises will emerge about Enron's finances, including those that could call into question whether its core trading business is as advertised. \nDynegy executives aren't expecting any such disclosures, but took a conservative approach to calculating merger benefits. \n\"I believe we have adequately bracketed the downside,\" said Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive. \nEven with a worst-case scenario, Dynegy still found a \"tremendous amount of economic value\" in the merger, said Watson, who will take the same roles after the merger. \nThe deal, Dynegy said, will add 90 cents to 95 cents per share in earnings for current Dynegy shareholders. And that's before cost savings that are expected to run $400 million to $500 million a year. \nDynegy detailed two escape clauses in the merger deal. For one, if the amount of legal and shareholder claims Enron must pay out is greater than $3.5 billion, it can be called off. \nEnron and Dynegy officials also said they will do whatever it takes to keep their key people. But will traders jump ship? \"Oh, yeah I'm sure they will,\" the industry source said. \nJeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons \u0026 Co. International in Houston, believes that a number of Enron's marketers and traders will find Dynegy a strong alternative. \n\"I firmly believe that the Enron guys like to play on the winning team and Dynegy is a very, very strong player,\" he said. \nThat Dynegy was approached by three key Enron executives about a merger showed Dynegy would be getting the full cooperation of Enron's management team, Watson said. \nEnron employees working for Dynegy will have to get used to a new culture. Teamwork and fraternal are words often used to describe Dynegy, while cutthroat is used for Enron, which also is known for its willingness to take more risk. \nWatson plans to blend strategies and business elements of each. \nThe new company will include Enron's strong offering of financial products and combine them with Dynegy's base of power plants and other assets, said Steve Bergstrom, Dynegy's president, who will take the same job in the new company. \nThe post-merger Dynegy will also be more involved in \"market-making,\" which Enron is known for. That's the practice of ensuring orderly markets can exist by acting as both the buyer and the seller of a commodity. \nIt's unclear whether Dynegy will continue Enron's foray into other commodities such as paper and metals. \nDynegy hopes Enron can complete its planned sale of assets considered outside its core wholesale energy business before the merger closes. \nEnron already has deals to sell power utility Portland General Electric along with about $900 million in international assets. Billions of dollars in international projects are for sale. \nBut Watson said Dynegy isn't interested in seeing the assets go at bargain-basement prices. \n\"We don't necessarily feel like our back is pinned against the wall in asset dispositions,\" he said. \n\nDynegy Pres: Enron's Core Business Is Very, Very Strong\n\nBy Christina Cheddar\n11/12/2001\nDow Jones News Service\n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) Chairman Chuck Watson said he sees \"nothing but upside\" ahead from \nthe company's planned acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), which was announced late Friday. \n\nIn addition to being a sound strategic move, the deal \"injects confidence into the energy markets,\" said Watson, \nfounder of the Houston energy trading firm, in a conference call held Monday to discuss the $8.85 billion takeover \nof Enron.\n\nOn Friday, Dynegy confirmed the widely speculated deal by announcing it would buy its cross-town rival in a stock\nswap that values each Enron share at 0.2685 of a Dynegy share. \n\nThe sale of Enron for only a quarter of its share price a month ago, or just a quarter of its all-time high of\n$90 a share reached just last year, follows an abrupt turn in Enron's fortunes. \n\nLast week, Enron, which is the nation's biggest trader of natural gas and electricity, admitted its financial \nstatements going back to 1997 couldn't be relied upon and would have to be restated. The company made accounting \nerrors in recording transactions from some of its limited partnerships. The company also misstated its level of \ndebt and its shareholder equity over this period. \n\nEnron's partnership dealings are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and have sparked\na number of shareholder lawsuits. \n\nOver the past month, new revelations about Enron's web of partnerships and off-balance sheet financing vehicles \nhave been uncovered almost daily. \n\nDuring the conference call, Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said it was a \"very reflective \ntime\" for him. \n\nWhen Lay transformed Enron from a natural gas pipeline company into a dynamic energy trading company that\nwas a darling on Wall Street, this was clearly not what he had in mind. \n\nLay said, \"I didn't expect to create the world's next leading energy trading company by merging Enron i\nnto another company.\" \n\nEnron officials said they were continuing their internal investigations of its accounting practices. \n\n\"We have disclosed anything and everything we have found so far,\" Lay said. \n\nEnron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley, who will remain with Dynegy after the merger\nas an executive vice president, said Enron will host a conference call \"later this week\" to further discuss\nrecent events at the company. The call will likely be held on Wednesday, he said. \n\n\nIn light of the uncertainty surrounding Enron's financial dealings, it is not surprising that quite a number\nof questions during the conference call focused on the company's liquidity and the potential liabilities Dynegy\nwould assume in the transaction. \n\nDynegy's acquisition agreement allows the company to walk away if Enron's additional legal and financial \nliabilities exceed $3.5 billion. There also are other \"material adverse change,\" or MAC, provisions, officials said. \n\nUpon the closing of the acquisition, Dynegy expects to post reserves to cover the cost of outstanding\nlitigation, said Dynegy's Doty. \n\n\"We believe we have adequately bracketed the downside,\" said Dynegy's Watson. \"There has to be a\nsubstantial, substantial material change in what we already know ... I don't want to minimize the impact. \nThat's why we have MAC outs.\" \n\nAccording to Dynegy's Bergstrom, the economics of the transaction assumed the potential risk \nfrom outstanding lawsuits. \n\n\"Even in that worst-case there is a substantial amount of economic value here,\" Watson said. \n\nDynegy expects to continue its due diligence in the months leading up to the deal's close, Bergstrom said. \n\nDynegy's examination of the business so far has turned up \"no surprises\" in Enron's core energy trading\nbusiness, Bergstrom said. However, the merger agreement has provisions in case the company's examination\ndoes reveal any, Bergstrom said. \n\n\"We don't expect to find anything material,\" he said, adding that Enron's core energy business is \"very, very strong.\" \n\nBased on its current information, Dynegy expects the acquisition to increase earnings by 35%, or between 90 cents\nto 95 cents a share, before taking into account expected merger cost savings. As a result, Dynegy now expects its full year pro forma earnings for 2002 to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 a share. \n\nAccording to Thomson Financial/First Call, analysts were expecting Dynegy to earn $2.57 a share next year.\nIn 2000, the company earned $1.43 a share before items. \n\nDynegy has estimated cost savings from the acquisition at between $400 million to $500 million. \n\nThe ratio of stock Enron shareholders will be paid is fixed and there is no collar to limit its range, said a\nDynegy spokeswoman. \n\nThere isn't a walkaway provision, but if the deal is terminated, Dynegy will own rights to Enron's Northern \nNatural Gas pipeline because of the $1.5 billion cash infusion it will provide to the company immediately. \n\nDynegy able to give Enron the cash infusion immediately because ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), which owns slightly\nmore than a fourth of Dynegy, will invest $2.5 billion in Dynegy. \n\nThe deal has a $350 million \"topping fee,\" a Dynegy spokeswoman said. She explained that if either party decided\nto terminated the transaction, that party would owe the other the \"topping fee\" if it were acquired by another party. \n\n\nDynegy's Bergstrom said he expects the acquisition of Enron will receive the needed regulatory approvals and \nclose within the next six to nine months. \n\nIn addition to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the deal must be approved by the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission. \n\n\"We expect FERC to be the pacesetter,\" Bergstrom said. \n\nUntil the deal closes, Dynegy expects Enron will have \"sufficient interim liquidity,\" Doty said. \n\"(The cash infusion) should immediately put to rest the liquidity concerns.\" \n\nBased on conversations Dynegy had with the leading credit rating agencies management expects Enron's \nratings to remain investment grade, Doty said. Meanwhile, Dynegy's ratings are expected to be affirmed \nat their current ratings, but be placed on watch for a downgrade until the transaction is completed, he said. \n\nAccording to Doty, Dynegy expects its debt-to-capital ratio will be below 40% after the acquisition closes. \n\nEnron said it wouldn't comment on reports published in The Wall Street Journal Monday that said its bankers, \nJ.P. Morgan Chase \u0026 Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) are considering making an additional $500 million investment\nin Enron. \n\nDynegy officials said marketplace speculation that suggested Dynegy was acquiring Enron because it was afraid\nEnron would default on a liability it owed Dynegy was incorrect. \n\n\"Dynegy currently owes Enron an immaterial amount, less than $50 million,\" said Dynegy's Doty. \n\nThe chief financial officer also pledged to make the combined company's balance sheet more easy to understand\nthan that of Enron. \n\nBut integrating the two energy trading companies will be more than just combining their balance sheets. \n\nAccording to Enron's Whalley, the integration of Enron's non-core assets trading businesses will be rather\nsimple, but combing the core trading businesses \"will not be the easiest thing to do.\" \n\nOne prevalent concern is that Enron's trading talent will depart for other jobs, and erode the true value \nof the business, which is rooted in intellectual capital. \n\nThe employees have seen their value of compensation, which was partially paid in stock options, erode with \nthe value of Enron's shares. \n\n\"I believe we will retain the people we already have,\" Whalley said. \"Most traders want to be part of the\nwinning team.\" \n\nHowever, the officials didn't say whether they were making any specific efforts to retain staff. \n\nStill, in the end, callers were most interested in learning more about Enron's past accounting practices and \nthe potential effects it will have on the future Dynegy. \n\nOfficials from both companies said they couldn't tell yet if there were any additional details that needed to\nbe revealed. \n\nEnron's newly appointed chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said \"Could there be more? Possibly.\nDo we expect more? No.\" \n\nMahon replaced Andrew Fastow, who resigned after questions arose related to a partnership he ran while \nchief financial officer of Enron. Fastow's activities are at the center of the SEC probe of Enron's financial dealings. \n\n-By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com\n\n\nDynegy Deal Sets Path Of Resolution For Enron - Analyst\n\nBy Christina Cheddar\n11/13/2001\nDow Jones News Service\n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) proposed acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE) \"creates a \nclear path for the resolution\" of the liquidity and financial issues plaguing Enron, said Ted Izatt,\na high-grade debt research analyst at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH). \n\nIzatt made the comments during a conference call held Tuesday with bondholders to discuss the proposed \nacquisition, which was announced late last Friday. \n\nLehman's investment bankers advised Dynegy on the transaction. Enron was advised by J.P. Morgan Chase \u0026 Co. (JPM) \nand Citigroup Inc. (C).\n\nOn Monday, the marriage of the two Houston energy traders received a warm reception as equity investors bid up \nshares of both companies. Recently, Enron shares traded at $9.25, up 1 cent, or 0.2%, while Dynegy shares changed\nhands at $45.00, up 69 cents, up 1.6%. \n\nEnron shares had fallen more than 80% in the weeks leading up to the transaction as the company posted more\nthan $1 billion in write-offs of failed investments and was forced to restate its earnings going back to 1997\nbecause it improperly accounted for the results at some of its partnerships. The restatement reduced Enron's\nprofits over the period by 20% and added millions to its debt level. Also, the Securities and Exchange Commission\nlaunched an investigation of the financial dealings of Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. \n\nThe chain of events prompted a series of credit rating downgrades and raised doubts about Enron's liquidity\nEventually, the concerns threatened Enron's core energy marketing and trading business because a perception \nof creditworthiness is vital to the business. \n\nIzatt said a combination of $1 billion in newly secured bank lines and the $1.5 billion equity infusion from \nDynegy has bolstered Enron's financial position. \n\nWith this additional cash on hand, the greatest risk to bondholders is whether the deal closes, said Izatt. \n\nThe analyst added he expects the merger to close because both companies are committed to the deal, and he expects\nregulators to approve the transaction. \n\n\"There is a lot of commitment to get the deal done,\" he said. \n\nHowever, if the transaction doesn't close, Izatt said he believes Dynegy's bondholders are \"very well protected\" \nin the transaction. \n\nAccording to Izatt, Dynegy's bonds are at an \"attractive level.\" The spread on the bonds had widened ahead\n of the announcement of the deal as rumors began to leak into the market, leaving the price of the bond in a \nweaker position. \n\nBut Izatt does expect Dynegy will merge with Enron, and the resulting company will emerge as a \"much stronger\n company,\" he said. \n\nFor example, the analyst expects Dynegy has the potential to achieve more than $400 million to\n$500 million in pretax, merger cost savings Dynegy is projecting. \n\nAlso, Izatt said Dynegy's cash infusion and purchase will help Enron to retain its position in the energy market. \n\n\"Dynegy is there for real,\" Izatt said. \"They intend to see this through to fruition and energy players will \nview this and (feel confident enough to trade with Enron.)\" \n\nUnder terms of the acquisition, Dynegy will pay Enron shareholders 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each Enron share \noutstanding. The value of the stock swap at the close of the market Monday was $10.12 billion. \n\nDynegy is making an immediate cash investment in Enron with the assistance of ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX). \nLater, when the deal closes, ChevronTexaco will make an additional $1 billion investment in the combined company. \n\n-By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","headers":{"Date":"Wed, 14 Nov 2001 07:33:40 -0800 (PST)","From":"massimo.marolo@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c10601151.1075841409230.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Enron articles","To":"farhad.ahad@enron.com, biliana.pehlivanova@enron.com, anya.beylin@enron.com, \r\n\u0009vladi.pimenov@enron.com, natalie.bondareva@enron.com, \r\n\u0009chuck.ames@enron.com","X-From":"Marolo, Massimo \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=2DAB6AFE-E5F74928-86256AD2-76BB74\u003e","X-To":"Ahad, Farhad \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=FAHAD\u003e, Pehlivanova, Biliana \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=BPEHLIVA\u003e, Beylin, Anya \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=ABEYLIN\u003e, Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=VPIMENOV\u003e, Bondareva, Natalie \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NBONDARE\u003e, fsedati@sarofim.com, Khleif, Samar \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SKHLEIF\u003e, Ames, Chuck \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=CAMES\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"inbox"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058bd6"},"body":"\nAs many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.\n\nMany CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058be0"},"body":"Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.\n\nThe call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  \n\nSpecific points:\nEES will be a part of the new company.  \nEnron assets will be revalued at closing.  \nThe investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  \nDebt/equity of combined company expected to be \u003c45%.\nBoth companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  \nChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  \nWatson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  \nIn what was termed a \"new approach\", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  \nRumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron \u003c$50MM.  \nLay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.\nAll of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.\nLay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.\nLay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  \nLay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.\nDynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.\nDoty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  \nOsprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.\nMany of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.\nWith regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.\nENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  \nBBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.\nMcMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.\nConsolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.\nWatson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.\nWatson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.\nWatson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. \nThe deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.\nMcMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.\nENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.\nThe merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.\nEnron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.\nInitial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  \nMcMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.\nDynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.\nDoty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.\nChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).\nWhalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'\nWatson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.\nWatson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.\n\nGive me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.\n\nPatrick Tucker\nx3-3055","headers":{"Date":"Mon, 12 Nov 2001 08:25:00 -0800 (PST)","From":"patrick.tucker@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c31884477.1075841409509.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call","To":"s..pollan@enron.com, lindsay.culotta@enron.com, e.murrell@enron.com, \r\n\u0009denver.plachy@enron.com, martin.cuilla@enron.com, \r\n\u0009geoff.storey@enron.com, virawan.yawapongsiri@enron.com, \r\n\u0009souad.mahmassani@enron.com, tom.donohoe@enron.com, \r\n\u0009kevin.ruscitti@enron.com, s..shively@enron.com, h..lewis@enron.com, \r\n\u0009c..giron@enron.com, bryant.frihart@enron.com, \r\n\u0009patrick.tucker@enron.com, linda.roberts@enron.com, \r\n\u0009laura.luce@enron.com, d..hogan@enron.com, frank.vickers@enron.com, \r\n\u0009trading \u003c.williams@enron.com\u003e, l..mims@enron.com, \r\n\u0009james.simpson@enron.com, john.hodge@enron.com, f..keavey@enron.com, \r\n\u0009brad.mckay@enron.com, jonathan.mckay@enron.com, w..pereira@enron.com, \r\n\u0009vladi.pimenov@enron.com, andrea.ring@enron.com, \r\n\u0009leonidas.savvas@enron.com, judy.townsend@enron.com, \r\n\u0009victoria.versen@enron.com, robin.barbe@enron.com, \r\n\u0009ruth.concannon@enron.com, scott.goodell@enron.com, \r\n\u0009david.jones@enron.com, jared.kaiser@enron.com, \r\n\u0009scott.loving@enron.com, kimberly.bates@enron.com, gil.muhl@enron.com, \r\n\u0009maureen.smith@enron.com, shauywn.smith@enron.com, \r\n\u0009craig.taylor@enron.com, jim.willis@enron.com","X-From":"Tucker, Patrick \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=PTUCKER\u003e","X-To":"Pollan, Sylvia S. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spollan\u003e, Culotta, Lindsay \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lculotta\u003e, Murrell, Russell E \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rmurrel\u003e, Plachy, Denver \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dplachy\u003e, Cuilla, Martin \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mcuilla\u003e, Storey, Geoff \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gstorey\u003e, Yawapongsiri, Virawan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vyawapon\u003e, Mahmassani, Souad \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Smahmass\u003e, Donohoe, Tom \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tdonoho\u003e, Ruscitti, Kevin \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kruscit\u003e, Shively, Hunter S. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Hshivel\u003e, Lewis, Andrew H. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Alewis\u003e, Giron, Darron C. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dgiron\u003e, Frihart, Bryant \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bfrihart\u003e, Tucker, Patrick \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ptucker\u003e, Roberts, Linda \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lroberts\u003e, Luce, Laura \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lluce\u003e, Hogan, Irena D. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ihogan\u003e, Vickers, Frank \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Fvicker\u003e, Williams, Jason (Trading) \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jwillia\u003e, Mims, Patrice L. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pmims\u003e, Simpson, James \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jsimpso\u003e, Hodge, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhodge2\u003e, Keavey, Peter F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pkeavey\u003e, Mckay, Brad \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bmckay\u003e, Mckay, Jonathan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmckay1\u003e, Pereira, Susan W. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spereir\u003e, Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vpimenov\u003e, Ring, Andrea \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aring\u003e, Savvas, Leonidas \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lsavvas\u003e, Townsend, Judy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtownse\u003e, Versen, Victoria \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vversen\u003e, Barbe, Robin \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbarbe\u003e, Concannon, Ruth \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rconcan\u003e, Goodell, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgoodel\u003e, Jones, David \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Djones8\u003e, Kaiser, Jared \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jkaiser\u003e, Loving, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sloving\u003e, Bates, Kimberly \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kbates\u003e, Muhl, Gil \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gmuhl\u003e, Smith, Maureen \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mgreena\u003e, Smith, Shauywn \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ssmith22\u003e, Taylor, Craig \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtaylo2\u003e, Willis, Jim \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jwillis3\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"inbox"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058be9"},"body":"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.\n\nTo assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.\n\nPurpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our \"live\" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:\n\nTest the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)\nProvide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup\nDemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week\n\nNature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:\n\nCredit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:\nProfile tests for \"external\" customers (role-played by Originators)\nProfile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)\nData and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems\n\nTraders and Originators:\nTraders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.\nOriginators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.\n\nInformation Technology:\nWill assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.\nAfter the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books\nWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.\n\n\nNext steps \n\nTraders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.\nOriginators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.\nUBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). \n\n\nRegards,\nDave

Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q\u0026A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. \n\nMeanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.\n\nI am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.\n\nDavid Oxley\nHuman Resources\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nAccess Cards\n\nThere will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.\n\nEmployees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.\n\nThere will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.\n\nIt is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.\n\nAccessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:\n5th \u0026 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , \nThe Sky Ring \nBody Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.\n\nRestricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:\nEnron Center South, 8th and 9th floors\nEnron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor \nArdmore Data Center.\n\nEmployees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.\n\nEstate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. \n3.\u0009You will then be asked to enter your destination.

The counterparty will not pay on these items until corrected.  In fact, the counterparty faxed back our confirmation with the requested change back in September.  Ann (I don't know eher last name) with ENA physical confirmations said that she was aware of these confirmations and that they had been forwarded to Elizabeth for her attention.  It is my understanding that once noted that there was actually no counterparty in our systems under this new name, the traders for each company should have been in contact to straighten this out.  I am unaware of that occuring or even if that is the correct procedure.\n\nI am cc'ing Vladi Pimenov because Sitara shows him as having created at least one of the deals.

The deals that Ann sent to me were not changed because the counterparty name was not set up and address information was not sent to me with the corrected confirmations.    These were sent back to Ann.  As far as I know the Trader did not give me any information on the counterparty name and address information..  If you have received this information on your end then I would suggest that you send in a GCP request so that Global Counterparty can set the counterparty up in the database.  Once this is done then you would need to send Sean the deal numbers that need to be changed.\n\nVladi, should the counterparty name be Coral Canada US, Inc.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \u0009Dozier, Scott  \nSent:\u0009Monday, October 08, 2001 10:16 AM\nTo:\u0009Riordan, Sean\nCc:\u0009Hernandez, Elizabeth L.; Pimenov, Vladi\nSubject:\u0009Deal Confirm for Coral Energy Canada\n\nSean,\n\nElizabeth should be familiar with what I will be refering to in this note, so please reference her if need be...\n\nThere are several ENA sales for Sep-01 production to Coral Energy Canada, Inc. which the counterparty is claiming should be billed under Coral Canada US, Inc.  The counterparty will not pay on these items until corrected.  In fact, the counterparty faxed back our confirmation with the requested change back in September.  Ann (I don't know eher last name) with ENA physical confirmations said that she was aware of these confirmations and that they had been forwarded to Elizabeth for her attention.  It is my understanding that once noted that there was actually no counterparty in our systems under this new name, the traders for each company should have been in contact to straighten this out.  I am unaware of that occuring or even if that is the correct procedure.\n\nI am cc'ing Vladi Pimenov because Sitara shows him as having created at least one of the deals.  Maybe he can clarify things for us.  One example of such deals is 1026087.  Bottom line is I need a way of receiving payment from Coral on these items.\n\nAll - please advise.\n\nScott Dozier\nClient Services - Settlements\nEnron Net Works LLC\noffice: 713.345.7213\nfax: 713.646.8420\nemail: scott.dozier@enron.com","headers":{"Date":"Tue, 16 Oct 2001 13:34:15 -0700 (PDT)","From":"scott.dozier@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c16392777.1075863463519.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FW: Deal Confirm for Coral Energy Canada","To":"sean.riordan@enron.com","X-From":"Dozier, Scott \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SDOZIER\u003e","X-To":"Riordan, Sean \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sriordan\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":"Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vpimenov\u003e"},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"inbox"}

This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.\n\nTo emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.\n\nThe Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.\n\nI truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.\n\nDuring my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058e66"},"body":"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.\n\nFirst, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.\n\nThe Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.\n\nSteve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  \n\nAs you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.\n\nIn addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.\n\nWe will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.\n\nThank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.\n\nLink to the press release: http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/012902Release.html\n","headers":{"Date":"Tue, 29 Jan 2002 07:25:46 -0800 (PST)","From":"coo.jeff@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c13530203.1075841414577.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Management Changes","To":"dl-ga-all_netco@enron.com","X-From":"Jeff McMahon - President \u0026 COO \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MBX_ANNCJMCMAHON\u003e","X-To":"DL-GA-all_NETCO \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DL-GA-all_NETCO\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"platter-p","subFolder":"inbox"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058c53"},"body":"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  \n\nThe settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  \n\nWe want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.\n\nKen\n\n\n\nDear ETS Colleague:\n\nOn Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  \n\nIn this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.\n\nThe company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.\n\nBeginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  \n\nOver many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!\n\nStan","headers":{"Date":"Fri, 4 Jan 2002 14:46:24 -0800 (PST)","From":"chairman.enron@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c3637070.1075841407396.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Northern Natural Gas","To":"dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide4@enron.com","X-From":"Enron Office Of The Chairman \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MBX_OFFICECHAIRMAN\u003e","X-To":"DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide4 \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DL-GA-ALL-5\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"inbox"}

To be clear, this means that any news regarding whether you will be retained or terminated will be delivered by the business units (not the Program), and it will be final.  Later this morning the business units will begin floor meetings, and will communicate further information and instructions to you.\n\nAs a result of these recent events, all activities and responsibilities of the Associate / Analyst Program are being transitioned to Human Resources.  Over the next few weeks, the Program's current HR Generalist Terry Bosien will work with the business units to make this transition as smooth as possible under the circumstances.  Through Friday December 14, please make Terry your primary point of contact for any questions or issues you might have.\n\nFinally, I must say that I'm very proud to have led this Program over the past several months.  I want to thank each member of my team for their hard work and dedication to the many things we've achieved.  I am grateful for the contributions all of you have made to Enron, and I wish you the very best of luck.\n\nWith best regards,\nBilly   \n","headers":{"Date":"Mon, 3 Dec 2001 08:31:54 -0800 (PST)","From":"billy.lemmons@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c20535117.1075841407958.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Associate / Analyst Program","X-From":"Lemmons Jr., Billy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=WLEMMON\u003e","X-To":"","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"inbox"}

We have discussed ENE's need to improve counter\nparty confidence on a number of occasions over the last few weeks, and we\nbelieve counter party confidence deteriorated further based on the\ninformation included in the 10Q, and the strong negative reaction in the\nstock and bond markets yesterday.  The tone of our discussions with\ncompeting traders and marketers (representative of ENE's counter\nparties--which are critical in maintaining ENE's volumes) is becoming more\nnegative.  While ENE is continuing to confirm that volumes are improving\nsince the lows on November 9, our market intelligence is suggesting\nimproment has stalled.  In addition and probably related, ENE's liquidity\nposition seems to be continuing to deteriorate despite significant recent\ncapital infusions.  We are reducing 4Q01 estimates to reflect lower volume\nand margin assumptions.  What would get us more comfortable?  ENE 8K\ndisclosure confirming higher volume and decent margins (ENE has committed\nto provide 4Q guidance by early-mid December, and/or a change in the tone\nof the counter parties that would suggest they are increasing trading\nactivities with ENE.\n\nOPINION ON THE STOCKS:\n   ENE.  No change in our opinion on ENE--the upside potential is simply\n   not worth the downside risk.\n   DYN.  DYN is likely to benefit in almost all outcomes.  If our concerns\n   about counter party confidence prove to be wrong, the upside associated\n   with the accretion in the transaction would likely be huge.  However, we\n   sense DYN is getting frustrated by continued restatement of earnings,\n   unexpected debt triggers and worse than expected liquidity problems.  If\n   the transaction falls apart, DYN would have some transaction costs that\n   would negatively impact cash flow in the near-term, but DYN would\n   benefit from gaining market share and hiring some of ENE's talent away\n   longer term.  A potential downside case for DYN is that DYN retrades the\n   deal on recent information, but is forced to reduced its flexibility to\n   terminate the transaction through material adverse change\n   considerations, this out come would concern us.  We continue to believe\n   DYN is a solid long-term holding for investors.  However, we are\n   recommending caution with new money, due to our belief that DYN still\n   has $5/sh to $7/sh of \"deal\" premium factored into the current stock\n   price which could be at risk if the deal fails.  We do not believe DYN\n   has significant accounts receivable exposure to ENE in the event the ENE\n   has further liquidity problems (we believe DYN's trading agreement with\n   ENE limits exposure to maybe $100 to $150 MM).\n\nCOUNTER PARTY INCENTIVES:  ENE identified in its 10Q that transaction\nvolume (especially long-term transactions) have declined since the 3Q.  If\nyou are a utility or industrial customer, why enter into a long-term\ntransaction with ENE?  Why not go directly to DYN or diversify with other\nsuppliers?  If you are a natural gas or power producer, why create the\naccount receivable risk?  If you are a counter party, strategically why\nwould you contribute to the continuation of the ENE machine--to the\nultimate benefit of strengthening another competitor (DYN)?  We believe\nthat ENE is offering attractive financial incentives (premium purchases\nand/or discounted sales) to entice counter parties to trade with them.\nHowever, this would also suggest ENE margins may be getting squeezed.\n\nEPS ESTIMATES (new/old/consensus):\n   4Q01-$0.20/0.35/0.42, FY01-$1.55/1.70/1.78, FY02-$1.50/1.50/1.90\n   We are reducing expectations for margins in the Wholesale segment from\n   9cts/mmbtu to 7cts/mmbtu--negatively impacting 4Q EPS by 10cts/sh.  In\n   addition, we expect contributions from Enron Energy Services will be\n   lower due to challenges in closing long-term transactions (much of EES's\n   earnings are mark-to-market recognition of the value created in\n   long-term agreeements) impacting our estimate by 5cts/sh.\n\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\nThis e-mail is based on information obtained from sources which Simmons \u0026\nCompany International believes to be reliable, but Simmons \u0026 Company\nInternational does not represent or warrant its accuracy.

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.\n\nThe call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  \n\nSpecific points:\nEES will be a part of the new company.  \nEnron assets will be revalued at closing.  \nThe investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  \nDebt/equity of combined company expected to be \u003c45%.\nBoth companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  \nChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  \nWatson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  \nIn what was termed a \"new approach\", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  \nRumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron \u003c$50MM.  \nLay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.\nAll of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.\nLay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.\nLay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  \nLay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.\nDynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.\nDoty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  \nOsprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.\nMany of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.\nWith regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.\nENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  \nBBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.\nMcMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.\nConsolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.\nWatson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.\nWatson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.\nWatson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. \nThe deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.\nMcMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.\nENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.\nThe merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.\nEnron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.\nInitial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  \nMcMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.\nDynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.\nDoty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.\nChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).\nWhalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'\nWatson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.\nWatson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.\n\nGive me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.\n\nPatrick Tucker\nx3-3055","headers":{"Date":"Mon, 12 Nov 2001 08:29:40 -0800 (PST)","From":"vladi.pimenov@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c2211840.1075841410711.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FW: Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call","To":"natalie.bondareva@enron.com","X-From":"Pimenov, Vladi \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=VPIMENOV\u003e","X-To":"Bondareva, Natalie \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Nbondare\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"pimenov-v","subFolder":"sent_items"}

This requires each affected Generator to install equipment and\nsoftware that can interface with the ISO's Energy Management System (EMS) to\nsupply telemetered data by June 1, 2002.\nThe GCP/PLP Phase 3 telemetry requirement was first introduced during the\nGCP/PLP Meeting held on March 8, 2001.  The Phase 3 technical standards\ndeveloped by the Direct Telemetry Working Group (DTWG) were reviewed at the\nMay 22, 2001 GCP/PLP Meeting and an implementation goal of June 1, 2002 was\nintroduced.  Subsequently, the installation deadline of June 1, 2002 for\nPhase 3 was communicated during the October 9, 2001 GCP/PLP Meeting.  The\nwork required to install and test equipment and software that can supply\ntelemetered data to the ISO's EMS must be completed by June 1, 2002.  After\nthat date, Generating Units 10 MW or greater in rated capacity that do not\nmeet the ISO's telemetry requirements may be precluded from scheduling\nEnergy or Supplemental Energy with the ISO.  The Phase 3 GCP/PLP\nrequirements are posted on the ISO web site at; \nhttp://www.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/gcp/requirements.html\n\u003chttp://www.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/gcp/requirements.html\u003e  .\nGenerating Units that installed a Remote Intelligent Gateway (RIG) or Data\nProcessing Gateway (DPG) have fulfilled this requirement if all affected\nunits are visible to the ISO and have been verified by ISO personnel.\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the Phase 3 telemetry\nrequirements, please feel free to call the ISO Client Representative for the\nGCP/PLP, Dave Timson at (916) 608-7065.\nClient Relations Communications 0328\nCRCommunications@caiso.com \u003cmailto:CRCommunications@caiso.com\u003e \n\n","headers":{"Date":"Wed, 9 Jan 2002 11:28:34 -0800 (PST)","From":"crcommunications@caiso.com","Message-ID":"\u003c6851677.1075841411904.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"GCP/PLP Phase 3 Telemetry Requirements","To":"20participants@caiso.com","X-From":"CRCommunications \u003cCRCommunications@caiso.com\u003e","X-To":"ISO Market Participants \u003cIMCEAEX-_O=CAISO_OU=CORPORATE_CN=DISTRIBUTION+20LISTS_CN=ISO+20MARKET+20PARTICIPANTS@caiso.com\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":"GCP - Engineers \u003cIMCEAEX-_O=CAISO_OU=CORPORATE_CN=DISTRIBUTION+20LISTS_CN=GCPENGINEERS@caiso.com\u003e, GCP - Market Participants \u003cIMCEAEX-_O=CAISO_OU=CORPORATE_CN=DISTRIBUTION+20LISTS_CN=GCP-MARKET+20PARTICIPANTS@caiso.com\u003e, GCP - Technical \u003cIMCEAEX-_O=CAISO_OU=CORPORATE_CN=DISTRIBUTION+20LISTS_CN=GCP-TECHNICAL@caiso.com\u003e, GCP Direct Telemetry Work Group \u003cgcpdirecttelemetryworkgroup@caiso.com\u003e"},"mailbox":"platter-p","subFolder":"deleted_items"}

Although\nwe have suggested primary stakeholder groups for each meeting, the focus\ngroups are completely open.  We have structured the meetings as focus\ngroups, rather than large stakeholder meetings, for two primary reasons:\n\n*\u0009We have better communication with smaller groups (~20) than with\nlarger groups (~75).  The ISO used this approach in a recent series of\nmeetings on uninstructed deviation pricing and had very good success.\n\n*\u0009We expect to have better-focused discussions by concentrating those\nwith similar interests into the same meetings.\n\nThe ISO does not want to exclude any stakeholder and would like any\ninterested entity to participate in one of the four meetings.  If your\norganization is not represented directly by one of the four identified\nstakeholder groups, you may attend whichever meeting you desire.  We do ask\nthat entities participate (either attend or actively participate by\nconference call) in only one meeting, although you may listen in to as many\nas you desire.  If you would like to attend one of the meetings, please RSVP\nto my Assistant, Julia Payton at jpayton@caiso.com or (916) 608-7069.\n\nByron B.

I got in touch with Dave Dietz ( it may\nhave been Dave Ried) at that time and it was apparent then that there\nweren't opportunities available. Since then, I have expanded on my\nexperience in the power industry with Enron in Portland, Oregon.\n\nAs you may know, Enron has filed for bankruptcy which has resulted in very\nuncertain times for many Enron employees including myself.  While I am still\nemployed in Enron's trading operations and believe we will be back trading\nas soon as we find a buyer, I have decided to seek other opportunities.\n\nI believe my experience at Enron, especially in power trading and\nscheduling, would provide me with a great foundation for success at OPPD.\n\nThe past 11 months I have been trading next day power in the California\nmarket.  My primary responsibilities included making markets on EnronOnline\nfor off peak and odd-lot power.  My average daily trading volume for these\nproducts ranged from 60 to 90 trades per day.  I also had responsibility for\nmanaging the scheduling function which had been my main focus for the prior\n3  years. Much of my time has been spent analyzing the market fundamentals\nincluding plant outages, transmission constraints, gas prices, weather, and\nHydro flows.\n\nOver the last 4 years in power marketing I have been involved in scheduling\nall trading hubs in the WSCC, including extensive experience with the\nCalifornia ISO. I also worked shifts in the real time group.  I also am a\nC.P.A. with experience in budgeting and earnings analysis with Northern\nNatural Gas Company, an Enron subsidiary.\n\nI am primarily interested in opportunities you may have in energy marketing\nand trading, but would consider other areas in your company. I have attached\nmy resume' for your review and want to inform you I will be in Nebraska from\nDecember 26th thru January 3rd.  I realize the Holidays are a busy time, but\nif you feel it may be beneficial to meet, I would gladly arrange to be\navailable. I can be reached at 503-624-7995 (home),503-464-3934(work), or\n503-701-9736(cell). I have also sent this information to David Ried and Dave\nKulisek.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon and I appreciate any assistance or\nadvice you may provide me.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPhillip Platter","headers":{"Date":"Wed, 23 Jan 2002 13:26:35 -0800 (PST)","From":"platter.oregon@verizon.net","Message-ID":"\u003c26183669.1075841415300.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FW: Resume' - Phillip Platter - Enron Power Marketing","To":"phillip.platter@enron.com","X-From":"Platter \u003cplatter.oregon@verizon.net\u003e","X-To":"Platter, Phillip \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=PPLATTE\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"platter-p","subFolder":"inbox"}

Since then, I have expanded on my\n\u003e experience in the power industry with Enron in Portland, Oregon.\n\u003e\n\u003e As you may know, Enron has filed for bankruptcy which has resulted in\n\u003e very\n\u003e uncertain times for many Enron employees including myself.  While I am\n\u003e still\n\u003e employed in Enron's trading operations and believe we will be back\n\u003e trading\n\u003e as soon as we find a buyer, I have decided to seek other\n\u003e opportunities.\n\u003e\n\u003e I believe my experience at Enron, especially in power trading and\n\u003e scheduling, would provide me with a great foundation for success at\n\u003e OPPD.\n\u003e\n\u003e The past 11 months I have been trading next day power in the\n\u003e California\n\u003e market.  My primary responsibilities included making markets on\n\u003e EnronOnline\n\u003e for off peak and odd-lot power.  My average daily trading volume for\n\u003e these\n\u003e products ranged from 60 to 90 trades per day.  I also had\n\u003e responsibility for\n\u003e managing the scheduling function which had been my main focus for the\n\u003e prior\n\u003e 3  years. Much of my time has been spent analyzing the market\n\u003e fundamentals\n\u003e including plant outages, transmission constraints, gas prices,\n\u003e weather, and\n\u003e Hydro flows.\n\u003e\n\u003e Over the last 4 years in power marketing I have been involved in\n\u003e scheduling\n\u003e all trading hubs in the WSCC, including extensive experience with the\n\u003e California ISO. I also worked shifts in the real time group.  I also\n\u003e am a\n\u003e C.P.A. with experience in budgeting and earnings analysis with\n\u003e Northern\n\u003e Natural Gas Company, an Enron subsidiary.\n\u003e\n\u003e I am primarily interested in opportunities you may have in energy\n\u003e marketing\n\u003e and trading, but would consider other areas in your company. I have\n\u003e attached\n\u003e my resume' for your review and want to inform you I will be in\n\u003e Nebraska from\n\u003e December 26th thru January 3rd.  I realize the Holidays are a busy\n\u003e time, but\n\u003e if you feel it may be beneficial to meet, I would gladly arrange to be\n\u003e available. I can be reached at 503-624-7995 (home),503-464-3934(work),\n\u003e or\n\u003e 503-701-9736(cell). I have also sent this information to David Ried\n\u003e and Dave\n\u003e Kulisek.\n\u003e\n\u003e I look forward to hearing from you soon and I appreciate any\n\u003e assistance or\n\u003e advice you may provide me.\n\u003e\n\u003e Sincerely,\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Phillip Platter \u003c\u003c File: PHILPLATTER_RES4.doc \u003e\u003e","headers":{"Date":"Wed, 23 Jan 2002 13:25:32 -0800 (PST)","From":"platter.oregon@verizon.net","Message-ID":"\u003c2551508.1075841415325.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FW: Resume' - Phillip Platter - Enron Power Marketing","To":"phillip.platter@enron.com","X-From":"Platter \u003cplatter.oregon@verizon.net\u003e","X-To":"Platter, Phillip \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=PPLATTE\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"platter-p","subFolder":"inbox"}

We have added eight new columns to the\nend of the CDN to provide a way to document Voltage Support and Unit\nSubstitution.  Attached to this Notice is a sample CDN to illustrate these\nchanges.\nThe first additional column on the CDN, VOLT SUPP, will be used as a flag to\ndetermine whether or not a unit has been called for Voltage Support.  A \"0\"\nin this field will signify the unit was not dispatched for Voltage Support,\nand a \"1\" will signify the unit was dispatched for Voltage Support.  The\nsecond additional column, VOLT SUPP MW, will be used to record how much\nenergy is associated with a Real Time Voltage Support dispatch given to\nNon-Synchronous Condensers.  This column will contain a positive value,\nwhich signifies the amount of energy that the unit needs to decrease its\nMarket Schedule.\nThe next six columns, SUB UNIT1, SUB UNIT1 MW, SUB UNIT2, SUB UNIT2 MW, SUB\nUNIT3, SUB UNIT3 MW, will be used to list the Unit ID(s) and number of MWs\nthat were substituted for the Unit with the original Dispatch Notice.  These\nsix additional columns will record each unit(s) that was(were) substituted\nand how much energy was generated hourly.\nThe modifications to the CDN will not affect any other systems, since there\nare no formulas associated with these columns. \nIf you have any questions, please call or e-mail any of the following ISO\ncontacts:\nYolanda Hernandez\u0009(916) 608-5938\u0009\u0009yhernandez@caiso.com\n\u003cmailto:yhernandez@caiso.com\u003e\nMiranda Shore\u0009(916) 608-1286\u0009\u0009mshore@caiso.com\n\u003cmailto:mshore@caiso.com\u003e\nMichael Glatz\u0009(916) 608-5727\u0009\u0009mglatz@caiso.com\n\u003cmailto:mglatz@caiso.com\u003e\n\n \u003c\u003cSampleCDN121201.xls\u003e\u003e \nClient Relations Communications.0921\nCRCommunications@caiso.com \u003cmailto:CRCommunications@caiso.com\u003e","headers":{"Date":"Thu, 17 Jan 2002 16:54:41 -0800 (PST)","From":"crcommunications@caiso.com","Message-ID":"\u003c19373654.1075841416289.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"CAISO Notice - Changes to RMR Conformed Dispatch Notice","To":"20participants@caiso.com, scsettlecontacts@caiso.com","X-From":"CRCommunications \u003cCRCommunications@caiso.com\u003e","X-To":"ISO Market Participants \u003cIMCEAEX-_O=CAISO_OU=CORPORATE_CN=DISTRIBUTION+20LISTS_CN=ISO+20MARKET+20PARTICIPANTS@caiso.com\u003e, SC Settlements Contacts \u003cIMCEAEX-_O=CAISO_OU=CORPORATE_CN=DISTRIBUTION+20LISTS_CN=SCSETTLECONTACTS@caiso.com\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"platter-p","subFolder":"inbox"}

They both suggested I contact both you\n\u003e \u003e and Dave\n\u003e \u003e Dietz at that time.  Though you did not have opportunities available\n\u003e \u003e then,\n\u003e \u003e my desire to work at OPPD is still with me.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e As you may know, Enron has filed for bankruptcy which has resulted\n\u003e in\n\u003e \u003e very\n\u003e \u003e uncertain times for many Enron employees including myself.  While I\n\u003e am\n\u003e \u003e still\n\u003e \u003e employed in Enron's trading operations and believe we will be back\n\u003e \u003e trading\n\u003e \u003e as soon as we find a buyer, I have decided to seek other\n\u003e \u003e opportunities.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e I am an Omaha area native and wish to return home and use the skills\n\u003e I\n\u003e \u003e have\n\u003e \u003e attained in the Power\n\u003e \u003e Industry. I believe my experience at Enron, especially in power\n\u003e \u003e trading and\n\u003e \u003e scheduling, would provide me with a great foundation for success at\n\u003e \u003e OPPD.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e The past 11 months I have been trading next day power in the\n\u003e \u003e California\n\u003e \u003e market.  My primary responsibilities included making markets on\n\u003e \u003e EnronOnline\n\u003e \u003e for off peak and odd-lot power.  My average daily trading volume for\n\u003e \u003e these\n\u003e \u003e products ranged from 60 to 90 trades per day.  I also had\n\u003e \u003e responsibility for\n\u003e \u003e managing the scheduling function which had been my main focus for\n\u003e the\n\u003e \u003e prior\n\u003e \u003e 3  years. Much of my time has been spent analyzing the market\n\u003e \u003e fundamentals\n\u003e \u003e including plant outages, transmission constraints, gas prices,\n\u003e \u003e weather, and\n\u003e \u003e Hydro flows.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e Over the last 4 years in power marketing I have been involved in\n\u003e \u003e scheduling\n\u003e \u003e all trading hubs in the WSCC, including extensive experience with\n\u003e the\n\u003e \u003e California ISO. I also worked shifts in the real time group.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e I am primarily interested in opportunities you may have in energy\n\u003e \u003e marketing\n\u003e \u003e and trading, but would consider other areas in your company. I have\n\u003e \u003e attached\n\u003e \u003e my resume' for your review and want to inform you I will be in\n\u003e \u003e Nebraska from\n\u003e \u003e December 26th thru January 3rd.

Since then, I have expanded on my\n\u003e experience in the power industry with Enron in Portland, Oregon.\n\u003e \n\u003e As you may know, Enron has filed for bankruptcy which has resulted in\n\u003e very\n\u003e uncertain times for many Enron employees including myself.

My primary responsibilities included making markets on\n\u003e EnronOnline\n\u003e for off peak and odd-lot power.  My average daily trading volume for\n\u003e these\n\u003e products ranged from 60 to 90 trades per day.  I also had\n\u003e responsibility for\n\u003e managing the scheduling function which had been my main focus for the\n\u003e prior\n\u003e 3  years. Much of my time has been spent analyzing the market\n\u003e fundamentals\n\u003e including plant outages, transmission constraints, gas prices,\n\u003e weather, and\n\u003e Hydro flows.\n\u003e \n\u003e Over the last 4 years in power marketing I have been involved in\n\u003e scheduling\n\u003e all trading hubs in the WSCC, including extensive experience with the\n\u003e California ISO. I also worked shifts in the real time group.

No deduction should occur on 12/31/01 payroll.  In addition, you should receive a credit for the deduction taken for the 12/15 payroll.  \n\nFor those who incurred any out-of-pocket parking costs during the month of December, you may expense up to $89 for reimbursement.  \n\nBeginning 1/1/02, parking and mass transit will continue as follows:\n\nWTC Parking:  You should receive your parking pass in the mail. Payroll deductions will begin on the 1/15/02 paycheck. (No Action Req'd)\n\nOutside Parking Lots:  Park at lot of your choice and pay out of pocket.  Request reimbursement of up to $89 per month. (No payroll parking deduction will occur)\n\nTri-Met and MAX employees:  Passes are available for January.  If you would like to pick up your pass, please see Debra Davidson.   \n\nNOTE:  Extra Tri-Met passes are available.  If you would like to select mass transit as your parking option, please notify either Grace or myself before Friday, 12/21/01 EOB and we will insure a monthly pass is available.\n\nValidations:  We will no longer validate parking passes, however, you are able to reimburse up to $89 per month for daily parking.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let us know!\n \nENA Human Resources\nJulie Kearney\n503) 464-7404\n\nGrace Rodriguez\n503) 464-8321","headers":{"Date":"Fri, 11 Jan 2002 10:39:40 -0800 (PST)","From":"julie.kearney@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c28851362.1075841417274.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"CLARIFICATION: Parking \u0026 Mass Transit Options","To":"center.dl-portland@enron.com","X-From":"Kearney, Julie \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JKEARNEY\u003e","X-To":"DL-Portland World Trade Center \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DL-PortlandWorldTradeCenter\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"platter-p","subFolder":"inbox"}

The notice further indicated that this practice was to be\n\u003e effective for the June, 2001 billing cycle. Beginning with the July 2001\n\u003e trade month, the ISO temporarily halted issuance of the preliminary\n\u003e invoices entirely.

The key to this latest in cutting-edge technology is the incredibly small size of the transistors - roughly 1/1000th the width of a human hair. Not only are smaller transistors faster, but more can fit onto a single processor, which makes for a higher level of performance at less power. The first Pentium\n 4 processor to be built on this technology, at 2.2 GHz, not only offers significant performance gains in internet, gaming, and productivity, but also gives you the headroom to take advantage of new technologies and applications in the future.\n\nFind out more about the Pentium 4 processor with the advanced new process technology. \u003chttp://intel.m0.net/m/s.asp?HB5171890317X1183648X89215X\u003e \n\n\nback to top\u0009 \n  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\u0009\n  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\u0009  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\u0009\n  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/orangeboxbottom.gif\u003e\u0009\n  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\n  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/orangeboxtop.gif\u003e\u0009\n  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\u0009  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\u0009  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\u0009  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\u0009  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\u0009\n  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\n  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\u0009  \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/spacer.gif\u003e\u0009\nNew: Enhanced Intel\n 845 chipset \u003chttp://intel.m0.net/m/s.asp?HB5171890317X1183649X89215X\u003e\u0009  New: Enhanced Intel\n 845 chipset \u003chttp://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/hed2.gif\u003e\u0009\nTo coincide with the launch of the Pentium 4 processor at 2.2 GHz, the Intel 845 chipset has been enhanced to support DDR (Double Data Rate) memory.

The notice further indicated that this practice was\nto be effective for the June, 2001 billing cycle. Beginning with the July\n2001 trade month, the ISO temporarily halted issuance of the preliminary\ninvoices entirely.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058d5f"},"body":"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  \n\nThe settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  \n\nWe want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.\n\nKen\n\n\n\nDear ETS Colleague:\n\nOn Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  \n\nIn this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.\n\nThe company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.\n\nBeginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  \n\nOver many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!\n\nStan","headers":{"Date":"Fri, 4 Jan 2002 14:46:08 -0800 (PST)","From":"chairman.enron@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c18941283.1075841417972.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Northern Natural Gas","To":"dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide2@enron.com","X-From":"Enron Office Of The Chairman \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MBX_OFFICECHAIRMAN\u003e","X-To":"DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide2 \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide2\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"platter-p","subFolder":"inbox"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058d6b"},"body":"To the West Desk et al:\n\nThe FERC's west-wide price cap has been raised to at least $108/MWh beginning today through 30 April 02.  Please see the order excerpt below.  Although market prices are well below both the old and new cap, the new cap will give the markets more breathing room if there is an unexpected cold snap and/or supply disruption.\n\nI am happy to report that the one of Enron's advocacy messages made it into the order: any change to the cap must be applied West-wide.  PNW parties and Duke were willing to settle with region-specific caps but FERC rejected that concept in favor of a single, West-wide value.\n\nAlan Comnes\n\nRelevant Passage:\n\n\"Effective on the trading day following the date of this order, through April 30, 2002, we will suspend the methodology used to calculate the current mitigated price and substitute the following West-wide winter season methodology. As a starting point, the\nmitigated price will be set at $108/MWh. This is the actual mitigated price set using the current methodology during the last reserve deficiency on May 31, 2001, based on a gas index of $6.641/MMBtu, a generating unit with a heat rate of approximately 15,360 Btu/MWh and $6.00 for the O\u0026M adder. The new interim mitigated price will supersede the existing mitigated price (approximately $92/MWh), which was set at eighty-five percent of the originally calculated $108/MWh mitigated price for application during non-reserve deficiency hours. We find this adjustment necessary to set the price for the winter period and to track changes in the gas indices.\n\nThe winter formula will maintain the current heat rate and O\u0026M adder. The one variable in the formula will be tied to the current average of the mid-point for the monthly bid-week index prices reported for SoCal Gas (large packages), Malin and PG\u0026E city-gate. Under the winter season formula, the mitigated price will be recalculated when the average gas price rises by a minimum factor of 10 percent (e.g., to $7.305/MMBtu) effective for the following trading day. The formula will also track subsequent\ncumulative changes of at least 10 percent (including reductions of 10 percent, but not less than a floor of $108/Mwh). Effective on May 1, 2002, the summer methodology will be reinstated along with the current mitigated price of approximately $92/Mwh for non-emergency periods.\"","headers":{"Date":"Thu, 20 Dec 2001 10:19:03 -0800 (PST)","From":"alan.comnes@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c3895364.1075841418236.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Details on the West-wide Price cap: now $108/MWh through April 30,\r\n 2002.","To":"sarah.novosel@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, \r\n\u0009d..steffes@enron.com, l..nicolay@enron.com, \r\n\u0009linda.robertson@enron.com, susan.lindberg@enron.com, \r\n\u0009tom.alonso@enron.com, ray.alvarez@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.com, \r\n\u0009tim.belden@enron.com, kit.blair@enron.com, f..calger@enron.com, \r\n\u0009paul.choi@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com, m..driscoll@enron.com, \r\n\u0009mark.fischer@enron.com, h..foster@enron.com, lisa.gang@enron.com, \r\n\u0009scotty.gilbert@enron.com, mark.guzman@enron.com, \r\n\u0009legal \u003c.hall@enron.com\u003e, tim.heizenrader@enron.com, \r\n\u0009paul.kaufman@enron.com, elliot.mainzer@enron.com, \r\n\u0009chris.mallory@enron.com, john.malowney@enron.com, \r\n\u0009susan.mara@enron.com, matt.motley@enron.com, dave.perrino@enron.com, \r\n\u0009phillip.platter@enron.com, susan.rance@enron.com, \r\n\u0009lester.rawson@enron.com, jeff.richter@enron.com, \r\n\u0009stewart.rosman@enron.com, gordon.savage@enron.com, \r\n\u0009diana.scholtes@enron.com, cara.semperger@enron.com, \r\n\u0009chris.stokley@enron.com, steve.swain@enron.com, \r\n\u0009mike.swerzbin@enron.com, kate.symes@enron.com, \r\n\u0009jennifer.thome@enron.com, steve.walton@enron.com, \r\n\u0009bill.williams@enron.com","X-From":"Comnes, Alan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=ACOMNES\u003e","X-To":"Novosel, Sarah \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Snovose\u003e, Belden, Tim \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tbelden\u003e, Shapiro, Richard \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rshapiro\u003e, Steffes, James D. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jsteffe\u003e, Nicolay, Christi L. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cnicola\u003e, Robertson, Linda \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lrobert3\u003e, Lindberg, Susan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Slindber\u003e, Alonso, Tom \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Talonso\u003e, Alvarez, Ray \u003cRay.Alvarez2@ENRON.com\u003e, Badeer, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbadeer\u003e, Belden, Tim \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tbelden\u003e, Blair, Kit \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kblair\u003e, Calger, Christopher F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ccalger\u003e, Choi, Paul \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pchoi\u003e, Dasovich, Jeff \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jdasovic\u003e, Driscoll, Michael M. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mdrisc3\u003e, Fischer, Mark \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mfische2\u003e, Foster, Chris H. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cfoster\u003e, Gang, Lisa \u003cLisa.Gang@ENRON.com\u003e, Gilbert, Scotty \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgilber\u003e, Guzman, Mark \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mguzman3\u003e, Hall, Steve C.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058d6e"},"body":"Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only\n\nThe purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.\n\nA number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.\n\nWe have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.\n\nHere are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.\n\nCash Desk\nEach cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.\nOn a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.\nIf the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.\nThe cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.\nThe cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.\nThe cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.\n\nMarketing Desk\nSteve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.\nThe marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.\nThe marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.\nMake sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.\nThe marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.\nWhoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.\n\nDeal Entry\nThe new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.\nWe should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.\nThis will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.\n\nI'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.\n\nRegards,\nTim","headers":{"Date":"Wed, 19 Dec 2001 16:58:18 -0800 (PST)","From":"tim.belden@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c27917142.1075841418313.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"New West Power Deal Info","To":"tom.alonso@enron.com, mark.fischer@enron.com, chris.mallory@enron.com, \r\n\u0009serena.bishop@enron.com, phillip.platter@enron.com, \r\n\u0009cara.semperger@enron.com, diana.scholtes@enron.com, \r\n\u0009sean.crandall@enron.com, f..calger@enron.com, jake.thomas@enron.com, \r\n\u0009stephen.thome@enron.com, stewart.rosman@enron.com, \r\n\u0009paul.choi@enron.com, chris.lackey@enron.com, jim.buerkle@enron.com, \r\n\u0009legal \u003c.hall@enron.com\u003e, christian.yoder@enron.com, \r\n\u0009elizabeth.sager@enron.com, john.postlethwaite@enron.com, \r\n\u0009w..white@enron.com, leslie.reeves@enron.com","X-From":"Belden, Tim \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=TBELDEN\u003e","X-To":"Alonso, Tom \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Talonso\u003e, Fischer, Mark \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mfische2\u003e, Mallory, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cmallor\u003e, Bishop, Serena \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbishop3\u003e, Platter, Phillip \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pplatte\u003e, Semperger, Cara \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Csemper\u003e, Scholtes, Diana \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dscholt\u003e, Crandall, Sean \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Scranda\u003e, Calger, Christopher F. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ccalger\u003e, Thomas, Jake \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jthomas5\u003e, Thome, Stephen \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sthome\u003e, Rosman, Stewart \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Srosman\u003e, Choi, Paul \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pchoi\u003e, Lackey, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Clackey2\u003e, Buerkle, Jim \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jbuerkl\u003e, Hall, Steve C.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058d71"},"body":"MARKET NOTICE\nDecember 17, 2002\nMarket Design 2002\nISO Market Participants:\nThe ISO has begun a market design effort, \"Market Design 2002\" or \"MD02,\"\nthat will culminate in several FERC filings over the next seven months or\nso.  This effort will put in place changes to the California electricity\nmarket beginning with the Real-time Market Pricing (\"Target Price\") change,\ncontinuing through the termination of the June 19, 2001 FERC market\nmitigation measures on September 30, 2002 and completing the changes by\nSummer, 2003.  This message will give you some background on the design\neffort and identify a few of the upcoming project milestones.\nBackground\nSince its start on March 31, 1998, the electricity market in California has\nexperienced many changes in market rules and operating procedures.  In\nFebruary, 2000, the ISO began a Congestion Management Reform (CMR) effort\nspanning the next 12 months, which culminated in the January 2001 CMR\nProposal.  Although this effort produced a comprehensive approach to\nresolving issues related to inter-zonal and intra-zonal congestion\nmanagement, forward and real time energy markets, local reliability and\nseveral other issues, and reflected considerable Stakeholder input, it was\nnever filed with FERC for approval nor implemented.\nThe significant and unforeseen operational and financial events over the\npast 12 months have changed the California electricity market substantially.\nOne of the most significant changes was the FERC Order of June 19, 2001 that\nimplemented price mitigation measures, not only in California but throughout\nthe West.  The price mitigation measures are scheduled to expire on\nSeptember 30, 2002.  Therefore, the ISO has initiated MD02 to complete the\nmarket redesign process that began with the CMR project and to ensure that\nupon expiration of the FERC-established price mitigation measures, there\nwill be adequate measures in place to maintain market/price stability and\nreliable ISO operation. \nMilestones\nThe following are a few of the short-term key dates for the MD02 project:\nDecember 21, 2001\u0009ISO distributes draft MD02 Design Elements to\nstakeholders for initial review.  This preliminary document will identify\nthe primary problems to be addressed and outline a proposal for addressing\nthem.  Although this will not be the primary document for soliciting\nstakeholder comments, the ISO will receive any comments you may have on this\ninitial document.\nJanuary 4, 2002\u0009ISO distributes MD02 Comprehensive Design Draft for\nstakeholder review.  This document will include greater detail than the\nDecember 21 Design Elements document and will be the focus of subsequent\ndiscussions with market participants.\nJanuary 14-17, 2002\u0009Focus Group meetings to discuss the MD02\nComprehensive Design Draft.  The format of these meetings will be similar to\nthat of the recent Focus Group meetings on uninstructed deviation pricing.\nThe targeted groups for these meetings are:\n*\u0009January 14:\u0009Load-Serving Entities\n*\u0009January 15:\u0009Generators and Marketers\n*\u0009January 16:\u0009Municipal Utilities\n*\u0009January 17:\u0009Other Control Areas\n\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009We will send specific details of the\nmeetings by the end of this week.\nJanuary 23, 2002\u0009Stakeholders' written comments on MD02 Comprehensive\nDesign Draft are due to the ISO.\nFebruary 1, 2002\u0009MD02 Comprehensive Design distributed to ISO\nGoverning Board members and stakeholders\nFebruary 7, 2002\u0009Present MD02 Comprehensive Design to ISO Governing\nBoard for approval.\nFollowing the Board's decision on the MD02 Comprehensive Design on February\n7, 2002, we will update you with a schedule for FERC filings and\nimplementation.\nThis is an aggressive schedule for an ambitious undertaking.  However, it is\nimperative that the ISO address basic design flaws of the market and make\nmajor changes where necessary prior to the expiration of the\nFERC-established price mitigation measures.  We also believe this schedule\nis necessary to put the ISO in a position to implement a comprehensive\nredesign that will occur in several phases beginning with the summer of 2002\nand continuing through Spring 2003.  \nWe look forward to working with you to develop this proposal.

It is available at\nhttp://cips.ferc.gov/Q\\CIPS\\MISC\\CA\\CA121901.000.TXT.\n\nHere comes the Federal Regulatory Santa Claus?  FERC's agenda for its 12/19\nmeeting is incredibly ambitious and appears to have queued up a large swath\nof high profile cases.  To speculate based upon the current, end-of-the-year\nagenda, it appears that there will be orders regarding RTOs at center stage,\nwith a twist of congestion mitigation thrown in (?).  Interconnection issues\nalso come up, including the CA dockets.  There's also an order coming in the\nCalifornia docket, but its not that clear whether this addresses the gross\nload issue, outage coordination, the must-offer requirement, or some other\nfacet of the \"market mitigation\" docket.  RMR contract updates and the\nvarious protests also come up for consideration.\n\nABB  \n\nItems of potential interest include:\n\nE-1.

The rebuild should address all the issues raised in the previous go-live as well as some additional capabilities for robustness.  Please note that we have already executed several hundred different test case scenarios \u0026 performed some stress testing using data before the Enron collapse.\n\nWhat we need now is help from you to continue to identify enhancements and/or bugs with FSP so that we can go-live with FSP once the new company starts trading.  Susan Amador will be available to help in any testing.  You should probably also coordinate with her when you are about to start testing so that our continuing testing doesn't interfere with your testing.  PWRTESTN \u0026 PWRTESTP should be all setup for your use.\n\nHere are some of the bug fixes \u0026 enhancements we have rolled-out with this latest release:\n1.  Bid Curve - Ability to bid on zero volumes (for import, export, and wheels)\n2.  Rebuild of all FSP application utilizing Direct Oracle Access components for faster database access \u0026 higher reliability.\n3.  Bug Fixes on database commits to eliminate database \"deadlocks\".\n4.  New aggregation scout to \"stream-line\" the template writing process \u0026 improve template writing performance.\n5.  SQL tuned \"Hour Ahead\" template writing.  Confirmed performance of 1min 30 seconds on heavy transaction volume days.\n6.  And many other small previously unidentified bugs.\n\nWe are very excited about this newest release and are looking forward to your feedback over the next couple of days.  Susan will probably be your best contact but please feel free to contact me at anytime.\n\nThanks,  David Poston\n# 713-345-7834\n","headers":{"Date":"Wed, 12 Dec 2001 15:20:23 -0800 (PST)","From":"david.poston@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c28415896.1075841418913.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"FSP Ready Again for Production","To":"bill.williams@enron.com, chris.mallory@enron.com, phillip.platter@enron.com, \r\n\u0009serena.bishop@enron.com, scotty.gilbert@enron.com","X-From":"Poston, David \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DPOSTON2\u003e","X-To":"Williams III, Bill \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bwillia5\u003e, Mallory, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cmallor\u003e, Platter, Phillip \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pplatte\u003e, Bishop, Serena \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbishop3\u003e, Gilbert, Scotty \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sgilber\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":"Nat, Steve \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Snat\u003e, Davis, Pete \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pdavis1\u003e, Burleigh, Matt \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mburlei\u003e, Amador, Susan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Samador\u003e"},"mailbox":"platter-p","subFolder":"inbox"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058d8f"},"body":" \nEx Government Affairs staff Guerrero and Cantrell are mentioned in this ....\n\nDecember 12, 2001\nVictims and Champions of a Darwinian Enron\nBy DAVID BARBOZA\nOUSTON, Dec. 7 - After an accounting scandal, a bankruptcy filing and mass layoffs, Enron (news/quote) has gone from model of management vision to case study for management obfuscation. Only one group of true believers remains: the people who worked there and just got burned there.\n\nThey may be in a minority. After all, 5,600 people have been thrown out of work in the midst of a recession. Most employees lost a huge part of their retirement savings as the value of their Enron stock evaporated. Many are furious at what they view as bungling or worse by top management.\n\nEven so, a surprising number of former employees lament the end of an entrepreneurial culture that more closely resembled a start-up than a Fortune 100 behemoth. That culture encouraged creativity and rewarded new ideas that worked, they say, even though its dark side, an almost manic drive to experiment with new methods and conquer new markets, resulted in its downfall. Where, they wonder, can they go from here?\n\n\"Innovative is a clich?, but that's what Enron was,\" Brandon Rigney, who operated the company's Web site, said on Thursday. \"This is four days gone from the place, and I'm already in withdrawal.\"\n\nEnron, which began as a gas pipeline company and transformed itself into the world's largest energy trader in the 1990's, created an associate analysts program modeled after Wall Street investment banks. Each year, it tapped 450 college graduates, half of them M.B.A.'s, to spend three years in rotating jobs at all parts of its empire.\n\nIt also gave workers opportunities to start new business units. The company's energy trading platform, Enron Online, was created a few years ago by a 29-year-old gas trader. It quickly became one of the most profitable divisions.\n\nIn recent years, the company came to be dominated by young people like Jeff Shankman, a Wharton School graduate who joined the company at 24. By age 34, he had become president and chief operating officer of Enron Global Markets.\n\nMr. Shankman, who has just left the company, said Enron was special because it \"didn't have a corporate hierarchy to encumber creativity.\"\n\nManagement experts like Gary Hamel praised Enron for breaking with convention and turning regular employees like the 29-year-old gas trader into corporate entrepreneurs. And Fortune magazine named it America's most innovative company for six consecutive years. The corporate makeover was largely the work of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who resigned as chief executive in August only six months after being promoted to the job.\n\nUnder Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey \u0026 Company consultant, the company tested new strategies, like structuring its corporate culture to mimic the marketplace.\n\n\"You could come up with an idea and get people excited,\" said Janel Guerrero, 33, who worked in Enron's government affairs department, noting that a friend in the broadband unit went to top executives with an idea and Enron started moving on it quickly.\n\n\"You didn't ponder; it was about acting very quickly and it was about being a first mover,\" she added. \n\nEnron rapidly created ventures to trade everything from energy, paper, pulp and lumber to broadband and advertising. But quickness sometimes exacts a price. Some ventures went broke, like Azurix (news/quote), its spinoff water company. The broadband unit lost about $1 billion.\n\n\"When top management got into broadband, metal, steel, pulp, we thought it was innovative,\" Mr. Rigney said. \"When people said, `We'll trade water and waste water - that's the future,' we said, `That's cool.' I didn't hear dissent in the ranks. But I drank the Kool-Aid with everyone else, even though it made my head throb.\"\n\nIndeed, the expansion into new areas drained the profits of the successful energy trading operations, critics say. Undone by shaky accounting and too much borrowed money, the company collapsed last month. But even near the end, it was buzzing with new ventures.\n\n\"I just got here five months ago,\" said Fred Radvansky, 38, who was attending a Houston job fair. \"I was part of a group of about 70 people. We were rolling out a new Enron model. We were going to start trading freight.\"\n\nIf inventiveness flourished at Enron, the freewheeling environment there also encouraged other and less agreeable impulses: cutthroat competition and management arrogance.\n\n\"It was kind of like a dot-com phenomenon,\" said Harvey J. Padewer, president of energy services at Duke Energy (news/quote), a big utility. \"They created a kill-and-eat culture.\"\n\nMr. Rigney, the former Web site operator, remembers it well. \"People tried to take work away from you,\" he said. \"There was a Darwinism for ideas, for projects.\"\n\nThat undermined the company's health, critics say. For example, it is widely believed that compensation for the people who negotiated deals with other companies was based on the size of the transactions rather than their long-term effect on the bottom line.\n\nAnnual reviews aimed at weeding out the least productive 5 to 10 percent of the work force damaged morale, and some longtime employees felt unwanted. \"There were all these M.B.A.'s coming in and they were evaluating things differently,\" said Becky Cantrell, who worked on regulatory matters. \"I was one of the oldest people at 55. When I saw someone my age it was a relief.\"\n\nFor all the doubts some employees harbored, others reveled in the derring-do atmosphere even after Enron's financial fall, and cringed at the prospect of being acquired by Dynegy Inc. (news/quote), a stodgy Houston electric utility.\n\n\"They bragged about being a meat-and-potatoes company with people who went to the University of Nebraska,\" one former Enron employee said. \"We had all these hyperactive Harvard and Stanford types. It would have never worked.\"\n\nAfter the merger fell apart, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2 and laid off about 4,000 employees in Houston. Over the next few days, television crews filmed weeping employees streaming out of the headquarters and carrying boxes of personal belongings, even as construction workers put finishing touches on Enron's shimmering new 40-story headquarters office tower. Some got word of their dismissal via voice mail. Others are still packing up and wondering.\n\n\"I don't think Enron will ever be recreated,\" Mr. Shankman said on Thursday, sitting on a nearly empty trading floor that was built for 500 people at Enron. \"Maybe we got into some businesses too quickly and too early.\"\n\nEnron officials and management experts insist it was not the corporate culture that brought Enron down; it was accounting mistakes or the ballooning debt of hard assets, like projects in Brazil and India.\n\nThose facts may now be plumbed by business school case studies. In the meantime, some former employees have created Enron alumni Web sites.

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058da8"},"body":"MARKET NOTICE\nDecember 5, 2001\nCAISO Antivirus Program\nISO Market Participants:\nAs you know, yesterday (December 4, 2001) hundreds of thousands of e-mail\nusers were hit  by the \"Goner\" worm virus.  Unfortunately, e-mail messages\nfrom the ISO inadvertently spread this virus to many of your work stations.\nThe ISO is very concerned that it not spread such viruses either within the\nCAISO or to the ISO's Market Participants.  We sincerely regret any\ninconvenience this may have caused you.  \nSeveral Market Participants have asked about the ISO's procedures for\nprotecting against and responding to computer virus attacks.  We would like\nto update you on our procedures that allow the ISO to detect a virus,\nisolate it  quickly, implement countermeasures until the antivirus upgrade\nis available and clean and restore our systems (servers and PCs).\nThe California ISO sends and receives thousands of electronic messages every\nday because of who we are and what we do.  During the normal course of\nbusiness, the majority of these messages contain attachments exchanging and\nproviding information.  One method used by malicious programs (Viruses,\nWorms, and Trojan-Horses) to spread is by electronic mail.\nIt is the attachment that carries the malicious program, not the email\nitself.  So, when a user opens an infected executable file, the malicious\nprogram is activated and initiates what it is programmed to do.  Examples of\nexecutable files that may be infected include, but not limited to, Word\ndocuments (.doc), Excel spreadsheets (.xls), or Visual Basic files (.vbs).\nCAISO's Antivirus Program uses a three-tiered approach where scanning\n(detect, clean or delete) is performed on email messages with attachments at\nthe Gateway Servers, the Mail Servers, and Users' PCs and Laptops.  All\nincoming and outgoing email with attachments are scanned for all known\nviruses.\nThat is a key element of an antivirus program.  New viruses or new strains\nof computer viruses, worms, and Trojan-Horses are discovered at an alarming\nrate.  Antivirus manufacturers try to keep up with the new discoveries and\ntry to be the first to market with the updates.  There are over 50,000 known\nactive viruses circulating the Internet today.\nOn December 4, CAISO experienced a malicious program--Goner Worm--attack\nthat contaminated our electronic mailing system sometime around 8:30 a.m.\nThe Goner Worm was a brand new program so our antivirus software was unable\nto detect it.  Antivirus software manufacturers discovered this worm on\nDecember 4, between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m.  Later that day, most manufacturers\ndeveloped an update to address the Goner Worm.  CAISO received the new\nupdate around 12:00 p.m. and by 3: 30 p.m. our Antivirus Team had our email\nsystem fully restored and functional.\nUnfortunately, during the time it took to recover (about 5.5 hours), many\nmessages were sent out automatically.  We apologize for any inconvenience\nthis may have caused you.  \n\nCAISO strongly recommends that all users take prudent measures to protect\nthemselves from malicious program contamination.  Precautions all users\nshould consider include:\n*\u0009Unsolicited email messages with attachments from unknown origins\nshould not be opened, but deleted. \n*\u0009When in doubt, DELETE. \n*\u0009All email attachments must be scanned before opening. \n*\u0009Ensure that your antivirus software is updated regularly and often.\nAlthough we are confident that our precautions ensure virus free\nattachments, it is always prudent to always scan the attachments with your\nown antivirus software.  Please contact your internal IT security department\nfor additional information regarding your antivirus program and procedures.\nClient Relations Communications.0715\nCRCommunications@caiso.com \u003cmailto:CRCommunications@caiso.com\u003e ","headers":{"Date":"Wed, 5 Dec 2001 17:20:06 -0800 (PST)","From":"crcommunications@caiso.com","Message-ID":"\u003c21273973.1075841419680.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"CAISO Notice - CAISO Antivirus Program","To":"20participants@caiso.com","X-From":"CRCommunications \u003cCRCommunications@caiso.com\u003e","X-To":"ISO Market Participants \u003cIMCEAEX-_O=CAISO_OU=CORPORATE_CN=DISTRIBUTION+20LISTS_CN=ISO+20MARKET+20PARTICIPANTS@caiso.com\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"platter-p","subFolder":"inbox"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"4f16fdbed1e2d32371058daf"},"body":"To All Employees:\n\nThis morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:\n\n-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.\n\n\n-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.\n\n-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.\n\n-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.\n\nThese are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.\n\nAs you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.\n\nFor our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.\n\nI know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  \u003chttp://home.enron.com/\u003e. We will also have a Q\u0026A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.\n\nWhen decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business.

It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.\n\nPurpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our \"live\" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:\n\nTest the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)\nProvide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup\nDemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week\n\nNature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:\n\nCredit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:\nProfile tests for \"external\" customers (role-played by Originators)\nProfile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)\nData and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems\n\nTraders and Originators:\nTraders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.\nOriginators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.\n\nInformation Technology:\nWill assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.\nAfter the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books\nWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.\n\n\nNext steps \n\nTraders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.\nOriginators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.\nUBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). \n\n\nRegards,\nDave

We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.\n\nI still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.\n\nWe are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.\n\nWhile terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.\n\nI appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.\n\nKen","headers":{"Date":"Fri, 30 Nov 2001 15:58:11 -0800 (PST)","From":"no.address@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c14036436.1075841419982.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","X-From":"Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman@ENRON","X-To":"All Enron Employees United States Group@ENRON","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"platter-p","subFolder":"inbox"}

What this means is that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed the Administrator to handle the liquidation of the company's major physical assets and trading positions.  This action does not include Enron Credit, Enron Direct, Enron Metals, Teesside Power Station or the utilities and service businesses at the Wilton chemical complex.  It also does not include Wessex Water or power plants in Turkey, Italy and Poland.\n\nEfforts are being made to preserve as much of the business as possible.  There is already interest by outside parties to buy Enron Europe's metals business, and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal in the near term.\n\nThis action will impact a significant number of Enron Europe's employees.  Every effort is being made to retain as many employees as possible who are part of businesses that may be preserved.\n\nEnron Appoints New Board Member\n\nYesterday, Enron announced the election of Raymond S. Troubh to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Troubh will chair a newly-formed Special Litigation Committee of the Board to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits.  He will also serve on the Special Committee set up to investigate all of the SEC-related matters.  Mr. Troubh is a financial consultant in New York City and has been a non-executive director of more than 25 public companies.  Board member William C. Powers, Jr. will also serve on the Special Litigation Committee.\n\nEnron Evaluates Dividends\n\nToday Enron announced that it is evaluating whether previously declared dividends will be paid on Enron common stock and other Enron equities.\n\nNew Enron Employee Q\u0026A\n\nA new Q\u0026A has been posted to \u003chttp://home.enron.com/updates/\u003e based on recent developments and employee concerns.","headers":{"Date":"Thu, 29 Nov 2001 10:52:16 -0800 (PST)","From":"chairman.enron@enron.com","Message-ID":"\u003c2219937.1075841420140.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Subject":"Enron Updates","To":"dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide2@enron.com","X-From":"Enron Office Of The Chairman \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MBX_OFFICECHAIRMAN\u003e","X-To":"DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide2 \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide2\u003e","X-bcc":"","X-cc":""},"mailbox":"platter-p","subFolder":"inbox"}
