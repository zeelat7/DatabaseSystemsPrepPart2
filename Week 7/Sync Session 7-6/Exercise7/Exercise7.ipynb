From their perspective, a “good” customer is one that is buying a lot from XYZ.  Not surprising, eh?  To start with XYZ marketing wants you to explore the data that was in the xyzcust data file. This is the data that in Session 2 you read in from the file xyzcust10.xyz, and that you subsequently wrote out to the SQLite3 RDB xyz.rb as a table.  (You did, right?)  XYZ marketing wants you to identify XYZ's current and past “heavy buyers,” and to describe where they came from, i.e. through what channel they initially purchased from XYZ.  Based on your results, XYZ may subsequently request some more fine-grained analyses of its “heavies.”\n",

To create a variable that tells which customers are heavy buyers, a “heavy indicator” that can be used for selecting and analyzing heavy customers, we need to know what 2009 purchase amount separates them from the rest of XYZ's customers.

Both variables are measures that are left-truncated at zero, meaning that they can't have negative values.  YTD_TRANSACTIONS_2009 measures counts of purchase transactions, so it's not really a continuous variable.  What shape or distribution would you say either variable's data should have?

It consists of collapsing the tails of a data distribution so that extreme values below or above specific percentile cutoffs, e.g. the values corresponding to 5% and 95%, are replaced with the values at those percentages.  We can Winsorize YTD_SALES_2009 by collapsing the extremes of its data as follows:\n",
